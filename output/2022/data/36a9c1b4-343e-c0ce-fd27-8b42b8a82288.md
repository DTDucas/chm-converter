# Members
| Member name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| --- | --- |
| Success | Operation was successful. |
| IncompatibleGeometry | Failed because the part didn't have the dimensions required to meet the geometry requirements. |
| MisalignedEnds | Failed due to misalignment of fitting ends. |
| DimensionLocked | Failed due to not being able to change a locked or product listed dimension. |
| BadDimensions | Failed due to the required dimension values not being valid to fabricate. |
| ShapeMismatch | Failed due to shape mismatch of fitting ends. |
| SizeMismatch | Failed due to size mismatch of fitting ends. |
| IncompatibleConnection | Failed due to connectors being incompatible and no couplings found to resolve it. |
| OffsetRequired | Failed due to additional offset dimensions or fittings being required that weren't available. |
| Unsupported | Failed due to unsupported routing path. |
