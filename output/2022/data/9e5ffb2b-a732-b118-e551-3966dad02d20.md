# Remarks
The location represents a point in the model where the [ImageInstance](ff77d6c8-a94a-067a-cd95-4f2cd3ec8dcc.md "ImageInstance Class") will be placed. The location of the image in the view is determined by the projection of this point onto the plane of the view. This means that in a plan view, for example, the z-coordinate has no effect.
