| Visible | The geometry object is always visible. This type of geometry is always returned by [Geometry[([( Options])]) ](d8a55a5b-2a69-d5ab-3e1f-6cf1ee43c8ec.md "Geometry Property") |
| Highlight | The geometry object is visible, but is affected by highlight or prehighlight special coloration. This type of geometry is returned by [Geometry[([( Options])]) ](d8a55a5b-2a69-d5ab-3e1f-6cf1ee43c8ec.md "Geometry Property") if [IncludeNonVisibleObjects](0d277b80-d5e5-1151-d413-b0899da0976f.md "IncludeNonVisibleObjects Property") is true. |
| Contextual | The geometry object is visible in some contexts, but not in others. This type of geometry is always returned by [Geometry[([( Options])]) ](d8a55a5b-2a69-d5ab-3e1f-6cf1ee43c8ec.md "Geometry Property"), even when Revit is in a context where the geometry should not be visible, but only if [IncludeNonVisibleObjects](0d277b80-d5e5-1151-d413-b0899da0976f.md "IncludeNonVisibleObjects Property") is true. Examples of geometry of this class include Solids representing insulation and lining for MEP ducts and pipes. |
| Invisible | The geometry object is never visible. This type of geometry is never returned by [Geometry[([( Options])]) ](d8a55a5b-2a69-d5ab-3e1f-6cf1ee43c8ec.md "Geometry Property") but may be obtained by other API operations. |
