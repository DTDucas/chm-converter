LocationPoint Class  
[Members](e1071a1b-b98e-5875-2e13-b673e2b9fef6.md "LocationPoint Members") Example See Also  
---  
Provides location functionality for all elements that have a single insertion point.

# Syntax
C#

```text
public class LocationPoint : Location
```
  
Visual Basic

```text
Public Class LocationPoint _
	Inherits Location
```
  
Visual C++

```text
public ref class LocationPoint : public Location
```
  
# Remarks
The location point objects adds additional functionality to its base location object class. This includes setting the elements location to a specific point and retrieving its rotation around its insertion point. Inplace families do not have a single insertion point and therefore do not have meaningful LocationPoint data.
# Examples
CopyC#
```text
void LocationInformation(LocationPoint position)
{
    String prompt = "The selected column location information:";
    prompt += "\nPoint:  (" + position.Point.X + ", "
            + position.Point.Y + ", " + position.Point.Z + ")";
    prompt += "\nRotation: " + position.Rotation;

    TaskDialog.Show("Revit",prompt);
}

bool LocationRotate(Autodesk.Revit.ApplicationServices.Application application, Autodesk.Revit.DB.Element element)
{
    bool rotated = false;
    LocationPoint location = element.Location as LocationPoint;

    if (null != location)
    {
        XYZ aa = location.Point;
        XYZ cc = new XYZ(aa.X, aa.Y, aa.Z + 10);
        Line axis = Line.CreateBound(aa,cc);
        rotated = location.Rotate(axis, Math.PI / 2.0);
    }

    return rotated;
}
```

CopyVB.NET
```text
Private Sub LocationInformation(position As LocationPoint)
    Dim prompt As [String] = "The selected column location information:"
    prompt += vbLf & "Point:  (" & Convert.ToString(position.Point.X) & ", " & Convert.ToString(position.Point.Y) & ", " & Convert.ToString(position.Point.Z) & ")"
    prompt += vbLf & "Rotation: " & Convert.ToString(position.Rotation)

    TaskDialog.Show("Revit", prompt)
End Sub

Private Function LocationRotate(application As Autodesk.Revit.ApplicationServices.Application, element As Autodesk.Revit.DB.Element) As Boolean
    Dim rotated As Boolean = False
    Dim location As LocationPoint = TryCast(element.Location, LocationPoint)

    If location IsNot Nothing Then
        Dim aa As XYZ = location.Point
        Dim cc As New XYZ(aa.X, aa.Y, aa.Z + 10)
        Dim axis As Line = Line.CreateBound(aa, cc)
        rotated = location.Rotate(axis, Math.PI / 2.0)
    End If

    Return rotated
End Function
