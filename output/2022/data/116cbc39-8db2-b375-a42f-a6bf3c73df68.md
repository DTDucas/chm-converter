# Remarks
Although the [Leader](66228564-d8b8-fc81-454c-e175528f7188.md "Leader Class") class supports all available shapes, not all types of leaders may have the option to change its shape. For example, leaders of text annotations can be of any shape, while leaders of level lines are never curved.
