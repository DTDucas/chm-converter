# Syntax
C#  
---  
```text
public IntersectionResult Project(
	XYZ point
)
```
  
Visual Basic  
---  
```text
Public Function Project ( _
	point As XYZ _
) As IntersectionResult
```
  
Visual C++  
---  
```text
public:
IntersectionResult^ Project(
	XYZ^ point
)
```
  
# ### Parameters
point
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..XYZ](c2fd995c-95c0-58fb-f5de-f3246cbc5600.md "XYZ Class")The point to be projected.
# ### Return Value
Geometric information if projection is successful.
# Remarks
The following is the meaning of every IntersectionResult's members: 
  * XYZPoint is the nearest point on the curve;
  * Parameter is the unnormalized parameter on the curve (use ComputeNormalizedParameter to compute the normalized value)
  * Distance is the distance from the point to the curve (equivalent to Distance).
