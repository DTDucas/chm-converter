# Remarks
When revision clouds appear on a sheet, the revision number of each revision can be displayed either by tagging the revision cloud or by a revision schedule within the sheet's titleblock. There are two ways the number can be determined: 
  * Per project: The value of the Revision numbers will always correspond to the project-wide Revision Sequence Number assigned to the revision. For example, if revision clouds for revisions with sequence numbers 5, 7, and 8 are placed on a sheet then revision tags and schedules on that sheet would display 5, 7, and 8.
  * Per sheet: Revision numbers will be assigned consecutive numbers based on the revision clouds visible on that sheet. For example, if revision clouds for revisions assigned project-wide Revision Sequence Numbers 5, 7, and 8 are placed on a sheet then revision tags and schedules on that sheet would display 1, 2, and 3. The sequence on the sheet will still follow the relative ordering of the Revision Sequence Numbers, so in this example revision 5 would be displayed as 1 on the sheet, revision 7 would be displayed as 2, etc. 

Note that changing this setting may change the numbering of revisions on any existing sheets. The numbering will be changed even for revisions that are already issued.
