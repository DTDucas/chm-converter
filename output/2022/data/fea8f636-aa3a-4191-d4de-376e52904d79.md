| [IsValidObject](6a5c7474-6ea6-4886-d356-204405406596.md "IsValidObject Property") | Specifies whether the .NET object represents a valid Revit entity.  (Inherited from [ShapeBuilder](66c1678c-2e01-e0de-1386-5a0e1eb3ccff.md "ShapeBuilder Class").) |
| [ViewNormal](a58d3c20-3181-899b-c583-98f2f9c94713.md "ViewNormal Property") | Normal of the view that will display the shape being built. Must be set explicitly before adding any geometry. Must be a unit vector. This is used to validate incoming geometry - it must be orthogonal to the viewNormal. |
