# ### Parameters
view
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..View](fb92a4e7-f3a7-ef14-e631-342179b18de9.md "View Class")The view where the new lines will be created. The lines are projected on the view workplane. The view workplane must be parallel to the view plane. 
detailCurves
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..DetailCurveArray](f01a6bd2-baaf-9551-d713-c08476153e55.md "DetailCurveArray Class") The detail curve array to be converted.
# Remarks
This operation will create new ModelCurves with the same geometry of the original detail curves' geometry. The detail curves will be deleted from the document. 
# Exceptions
| Exception | Condition |
| --- | --- |
| --- | --- |
| System..::..ArgumentNullException | Thrown when the input argument is nullNothingnullptra null reference (Nothing in Visual Basic). |
