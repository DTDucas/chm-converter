# Methods
| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Create](fc1bff98-15ce-be6e-5a23-89e20aad9e1d.md "Create Method") | Creates a conical surface defined by a local reference frame and a half angle. |
| [Dispose](c9ee1344-bc19-d833-52e7-dcc4931fe085.md "Dispose Method") | (Inherited from [Surface](bb391358-5ca0-578d-e8e2-6d1b30c472d8.md "Surface Class").) |
| Equals | Determines whether the specified Object is equal to the current Object. (Inherited from Object.) |
| [GetBoundingBoxUV](5084214f-219f-780f-fe03-f16b62b2660d.md "GetBoundingBoxUV Method") | Gets the UV bounding box of the surface.  (Inherited from [Surface](bb391358-5ca0-578d-e8e2-6d1b30c472d8.md "Surface Class").) |
| [GetFrameOfReference](59ae1045-6128-4daa-ca37-db36309d9905.md "GetFrameOfReference Method") | Returns frame of reference associated with this ConicalSurface. |
| GetHashCode | Serves as a hash function for a particular type.  (Inherited from Object.) |
| GetType | Gets the Type of the current instance. (Inherited from Object.) |
| [IsValidConeAngle](33f4d39f-a8b1-ef85-d423-fdc5044b8253.md "IsValidConeAngle Method") | Checks whether the input value lies is not 0, greater than -PI/2 and lesser than PI/2. |
| [Project](802cc09b-d0a4-dfc5-8ca1-e8c5e8cd4ced.md "Project Method") | Project a 3D point orthogonally onto a surface (to find the nearest point). Throws InvalidOperationException if the projection fails.  (Inherited from [Surface](bb391358-5ca0-578d-e8e2-6d1b30c472d8.md "Surface Class").) |
| [ProjectWithGuessPoint](db8cc42a-9f34-611a-d9c5-852f3935887f.md "ProjectWithGuessPoint Method") | Project a 3D point orthogonally onto a surface (to find the nearest point). This method is meant to be used when a good approximate solution for the projection is available. Throws InvalidOperationException if the projection fails.  (Inherited from [Surface](bb391358-5ca0-578d-e8e2-6d1b30c472d8.md "Surface Class").) |
| ToString | Returns a string that represents the current object. (Inherited from Object.) |

# Properties

| --- | --- |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Axis](a50b1b88-0918-cb30-b5f8-84e1f1d2dd6c.md "Axis Property") | Axis of the cone. This is the Z axis of the local coordinate system associated with this cone. |
| [HalfAngle](6f71508a-2228-bd57-f851-d2d540f4704e.md "HalfAngle Property") | Cone angle. |
| [IsValidObject](6429595a-a6e1-2501-1e60-9c53814a9108.md "IsValidObject Property") | Specifies whether the .NET object represents a valid Revit entity.  (Inherited from [Surface](bb391358-5ca0-578d-e8e2-6d1b30c472d8.md "Surface Class").) |
| [OrientationMatchesParametricOrientation](451b549f-2bc4-4f37-9f32-981fe18868a8.md "OrientationMatchesParametricOrientation Property") | Indicates whether this Surface's orientation is the same as or opposite to its parametric orientation.  (Inherited from [Surface](bb391358-5ca0-578d-e8e2-6d1b30c472d8.md "Surface Class").) |
| [Origin](41ec6924-4e43-9375-31a4-bdbcf209b454.md "Origin Property") | Apex of the cone. This is the origin of the local coordinate system associated with this cone. |
| [XDir](9f38585d-9ab8-5f41-7713-14f7acd5760e.md "XDir Property") | X axis of the local coordinate system associated with this cone. |
| [YDir](04a0fdd6-3ee4-df1f-c571-5e81550c65cf.md "YDir Property") | X axis of the local coordinate system associated with this cone. |
