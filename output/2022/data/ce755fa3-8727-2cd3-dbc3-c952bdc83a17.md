| Abort | Do nothing. |
| Salvage | Ignore invalid data, and use all valid data. Note that if a complete set of data describes a solid and some data are ignored, then the result will be a sheet and not a solid. |
| Mesh | If a requested geometrical object cannot be built using all data from the face set(s), create a mesh while using as much data from the face set(s) as possible. |
