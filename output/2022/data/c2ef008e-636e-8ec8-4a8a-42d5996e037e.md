# ### Parameters
document
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..Document](db03274b-a107-aa32-9034-f3e0df4bb1ec.md "Document Class") The document. 
connector1
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..Connector](11e07082-b3f2-26a1-de79-16535f44716c.md "Connector Class") The first end connector of placeholder to be connected to the second. 
connector2
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..Connector](11e07082-b3f2-26a1-de79-16535f44716c.md "Connector Class") The second end connector of placeholder to be connected to the first. 
connector3
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..Connector](11e07082-b3f2-26a1-de79-16535f44716c.md "Connector Class") The third end connector of placeholder to be connected to the first or second. 
# ### Return Value
True if connection succeeds, false otherwise. 
# Remarks
The three placeholders may or may not have physically connections. However, the first one should be collinear with the second and third one must have intersection with first and second. If first placeholder and second placeholder have the same size, the second one is merged with first one and original placeholder element will be invalid. If connection fails, the placeholders cannot be physically connected.
