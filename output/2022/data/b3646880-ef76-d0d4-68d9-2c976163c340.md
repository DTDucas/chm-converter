# ### Parameters
document
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..Document](db03274b-a107-aa32-9034-f3e0df4bb1ec.md "Document Class") The document to which the new MultiReferenceAnnotation will be added. 
ownerViewId
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..ElementId](44f3f7b1-3229-3404-93c9-dc5e70337dd6.md "ElementId Class") The view in which the multi-reference annotation will appear. 
options
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..MultiReferenceAnnotationOptions](2e081b6c-38fd-4f03-a372-0dfa841e6248.md "MultiReferenceAnnotationOptions Class") The creation options for the new MultiReferenceAnnotation. 
# ### Return Value
The new MultiReferenceAnnotation. 
# Remarks

| --- | --- |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions..::..ArgumentException](2e6e4206-97a8-dd4b-df5d-4269f4bb6088.md "ArgumentException Class") | document is not a project document. -or- The ElementId ownerViewId does not correspond to a View. -or- The ElementId ownerViewId is a view template. -or- The ElementId ownerViewId is a perspective view. -or- The 3D view ownerViewId is not locked. -or- The input 3D view cannot be used to place a MultiReferenceAnnotation object. -or- dimension line direction and dimension plane normal are not orthogonal. -or- There is at least one element that doesn't match the reference category of the MultiReferenceAnnotationType, or there are no elements. -or- for DimensionStyleType LinearFixed dimensions the dimension line direction must be parallel to either the view's vertical or horizontal direction. -or- some references can't be used with a DimensionStyleType Linear dimension of this direction. References must either appear as points in the view or be linear references which are perpendicular to the dimension line. -or- some references can't be used with a DimensionStyleType LinearFixed dimension. Only references which appear as points in the view can be used. |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions..::..ArgumentNullException](631e1424-60f4-929b-4e52-dda9dcd26316.md "ArgumentNullException Class") | A non-optional argument was null |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions..::..ModificationForbiddenException](53205486-5917-7c33-8e67-e362106ddc97.md "ModificationForbiddenException Class") | The document is in failure mode: an operation has failed, and Revit requires the user to either cancel the operation or fix the problem (usually by deleting certain elements). -or- The document is being loaded, or is in the midst of another sensitive process. |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions..::..ModificationOutsideTransactionException](8f025460-c283-ea99-aa8a-5a36e11528f4.md "ModificationOutsideTransactionException Class") | The document has no open transaction. |
