# Remarks
This element represents a value of a FamilyType Parameter of a Loaded Family. Each such element corresponds to a nested FamilyType Element in the original Family Document where the family was defined.
This element stores only basic information about the nested FamilyType, such as the name of the Type, name of the Family, and a Category.
These elements are very low-level and thus bypassed by standard element filters. However, it is possible to obtain a set of applicable elements of this class for a FamilyType parameter of a family by calling [!:Autodesk::Revit::DB::Family::GetFamilyTypeParameterValues]
