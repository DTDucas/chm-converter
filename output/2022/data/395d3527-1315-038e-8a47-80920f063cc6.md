# Remarks
Each slot can be in one of the following states: 
  * Empty. 
  * Occupied by an instance of the default family of the repeater that contains the slot. 
  * Occupied by an instance of another family. 

Initially, every occupied slot holds an instance of the default family of the repeater, based on the original element that was repeated.
