# ### Field Value
The sketch plane, or nullNothingnullptra null reference (Nothing in Visual Basic) for views which don't allow sketching (such as schedules) or for views that allow model curve creation but have no current sketch plane assigned.
# Remarks
If this property is set in when the current work plane is visible, the updated work plane will not be shown until the current transaction is committed. Therefore it is recommended the Add-On commits the transaction before performing UI operations (for example, PickPoint).
