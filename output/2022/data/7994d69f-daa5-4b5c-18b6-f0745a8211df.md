The maximum length allowed for any chord on an edge or between any two adjacent grid lines. This is a percentage value. By exporting, the real value of maximum edge length is calculated as a percent from the length of the diameter of the body bounding box. The minimum allowed value is 0.1%. The maximum allowed value is 10.0%. By default this property is ignored.

# Remarks
This property can be set by using export resolution type (by creation of STLExportOptions or using [!:Autodesk::Revit::DB::STLExportOptions::setTessellationSettings(STLExportResolution::Enum)] method). In the case of Fine, Medium and Coarse resolutions, this property has the same value (10.0%) and it is considered as explicitly set by the user. In the case of Custom resolution type, this property is only allowed to be obtained if it has been explicitly set.
