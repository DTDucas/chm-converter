DirectShapeLibrary is used to store pre-created geometry for further referencing via the definition/instance mechanism. It is not persistent: the scope of a library object is usually a single data creation session. DirectShape::createGeometryInstance and DirectShape::CreateElementInstance will use the current DirectShapeLibrary to look up the definitions. store a collection of GNodes as definition end class DirectShapeDefinition

# Remarks
There are two ways to add a definition to the library. The first is to add the definition as an array of geometry objects. A DirectShape created as an instance of that definition will hold a copy of predefined geometry, transformed as requested. If the definition was added as a DirectShapeType, a DirectShape object created as an instance of that definition will reference the type. Its geometry would be an instance of type geometry.
