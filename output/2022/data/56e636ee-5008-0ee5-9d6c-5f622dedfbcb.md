---  
```text
public Document EditFamily(
	Family loadedFamily
)
```
  
Visual Basic  
---  
```text
Public Function EditFamily ( _
	loadedFamily As Family _
) As Document

# ### Parameters
loadedFamily
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..Family](f51d019d-6ff3-692b-d1d2-b497cab564de.md "Family Class")The loaded family in current document.
# ### Return Value
Reference of the document of the family.
# Remarks
This creates an independent copy of the family for editing. To apply the changes back to the family stored in the document, use the LoadFamily overload accepting [IFamilyLoadOptions](d447ed92-74e1-2125-dd0a-38a5ae85ce53.md "IFamilyLoadOptions Interface"). 
This method may not be called if the document is currently modifiable (has an open transaction) or is in a read-only state. The method may not be called during dynamic updates. To test the document's current status, check the values of IsModifiable and IsReadOnly properties.

        Family family = familyInstance.Symbol.Family;

        // Get Family document for family
        Document familyDoc = document.EditFamily(family);
        if (null != familyDoc && familyDoc.IsFamilyDocument == true)
        {
            String loadedFamilies = "FamilySymbols in " + family.Name + ":\n";
