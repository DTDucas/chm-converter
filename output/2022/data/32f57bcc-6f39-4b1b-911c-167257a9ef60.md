| --- | --- | --- |
| [BreakPattern](c03aa9c6-809c-71c1-a919-f6689afc8b74.md "BreakPattern Property") | The condition which controls breaking baluster patterns distribution. |
| [DistributionJustification](f9108468-6603-5766-52fb-9914c441d59b.md "DistributionJustification Property") | Determines how baluster pattern distribution is justified. |
