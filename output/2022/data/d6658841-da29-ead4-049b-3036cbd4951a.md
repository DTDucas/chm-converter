Also nullNothingnullptra null reference (Nothing in Visual Basic) if there is no target room assigned to the last phase.
# Remarks
Revit automatically calculates the "From Room" for a given door or window. This is the default shown when creating a door or window schedule and adding the "From Room" properties. The user can opt to swap the "From Room" and "To Room" values via the schedule if they choose. The method [FlipFromToRoom()()()()](ae1158c1-1fb0-0558-0ea4-e1cf76bb8a1e.md "FlipFromToRoom Method") also can be used to swap the values.
