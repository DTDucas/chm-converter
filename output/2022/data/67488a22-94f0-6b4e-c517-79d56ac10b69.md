# Properties
| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [CannotUseCurvesForFaceSplit](7bd8dda8-92d3-bf78-ff59-675025a2f47c.md "CannotUseCurvesForFaceSplit Property") | The sketch cannot split the face of the highlighted element. |
| [EndsNotOnEdgeError](06d542ee-8006-582f-3eb2-2091438b855e.md "EndsNotOnEdgeError Property") | Ends of an open loop in sketch splitting face do not lie on an edge of the face to split. |
| [InvalidClosedLoopsForFaceSplit](ff21648e-5c98-1266-a2fa-94344fcc75b6.md "InvalidClosedLoopsForFaceSplit Property") | The closed loop used to split the face must lie completely within the face and cannot intersect or overlap any of the face's edges. To split a face at its border, use an open loop that ends on the boundary of the face. |
| [InvalidOpenLoopsForFaceSplit](995f3404-810c-25ce-8c15-6460b8750948.md "InvalidOpenLoopsForFaceSplit Property") | The open loops used to split the face must lie completely within the face and cannot intersect or overlap any of the face's edges. |
| [LoopsDoNotSubdivideFace](6700b99f-c3cc-9bfd-53ad-3d5abf317764.md "LoopsDoNotSubdivideFace Property") | Sketched loops must sub-divide the face into two or more completely enclosed regions. |
| [LoopsOutsideFaceSplitError](535caf99-8515-86c5-c505-8f7d6eedaa64.md "LoopsOutsideFaceSplitError Property") | Some of the lines drawn lie outside of the boundary of the face being split. All lines used to split a face must be contained within the face being split and cannot intersect or overlap any of the boundaries of that face. |
| [NoFaceForSplit](923a8482-ba81-100c-261c-96802a202ee2.md "NoFaceForSplit Property") | The highlighted element no longer contains a face that has been split by highlighted sketch. |
