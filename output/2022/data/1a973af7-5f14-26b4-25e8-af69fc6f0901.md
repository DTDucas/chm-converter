# Remarks
A ruled surface is created by sweeping a line between two profile curves or between a curve and a point (a point and a curve). For details on the parameterization, refer to the documentation for [RuledSurface](9a33fec9-bbcd-f035-3194-cf36122b6cc6.md "RuledSurface Class"). 
# Examples
CopyC#
```text
private void GetRuledFaceInfo(Face face)
{
    RuledFace ruledFace = face as RuledFace;
    if (null != ruledFace)
    {
        Curve curve = ruledFace.get_Curve(0);
        XYZ point = ruledFace.get_Point(0);
    }
}
```

CopyVB.NET
```text
Private Sub GetRuledFaceInfo(face As Face)
    Dim ruledFace As RuledFace = TryCast(face, RuledFace)
    If ruledFace IsNot Nothing Then
        Dim curve As Curve = ruledFace.Curve(0)
        Dim point As XYZ = ruledFace.Point(0)
    End If
