# Syntax
C#  
---  
```text
public static View3D CreatePerspective(
	Document document,
	ElementId viewFamilyTypeId
)
```
  
Visual Basic  
---  
```text
Public Shared Function CreatePerspective ( _
	document As Document, _
	viewFamilyTypeId As ElementId _
) As View3D
```
  
Visual C++

	Document^ document, 
	ElementId^ viewFamilyTypeId
)

# ### Parameters
document
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..Document](db03274b-a107-aa32-9034-f3e0df4bb1ec.md "Document Class") The document to which the new View3D will be added. 
viewFamilyTypeId
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..ElementId](44f3f7b1-3229-3404-93c9-dc5e70337dd6.md "ElementId Class") The id of the ViewFamilyType which will be used by the new View3D. The type needs to be a ThreeDimensional ViewType. 
# ### Return Value
The new perspective View3D. 
# Remarks
The new View3D will receive a unique view name. The view will be oriented in the same position as the default 3D view. 
# Examples
CopyVB.NET
```text
' Find a 3D view type
Dim collector1 As New FilteredElementCollector(document)
collector1 = collector1.OfClass(GetType(ViewFamilyType))
Dim viewFamilyTypes As IEnumerable(Of ViewFamilyType)

viewFamilyTypes = From elem In collector1 _
                  Let vftype = TryCast(elem, ViewFamilyType) _
                  Where vftype.ViewFamily = ViewFamily.ThreeDimensional _
                  Select vftype
' Create a new Perspective View3D
Dim view3D__1 As View3D = View3D.CreatePerspective(document, viewFamilyTypes.First().Id)
If view3D__1 IsNot Nothing Then
    ' By default, the 3D view uses a default orientation.
    ' Change the orientation by creating and setting a ViewOrientation3D 
    Dim eye As New XYZ(0, -100, 10)
    Dim up As New XYZ(0, 0, 1)
    Dim forward As New XYZ(0, 1, 0)
    view3D__1.SetOrientation(New ViewOrientation3D(eye, up, forward))

    ' turn off the far clip plane with standard parameter API
    Dim farClip As Parameter = view3D__1.LookupParameter("Far Clip Active")
    farClip.[Set](0)
End If
```
