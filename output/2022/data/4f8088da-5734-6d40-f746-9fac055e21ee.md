The [RebarShapeConstraintProjectedSegmentLength](a41486b4-25c4-c955-f1ab-c585ffb92bd2.md "RebarShapeConstraintProjectedSegmentLength Class") type exposes the following members.
# Properties
| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Direction](ac104515-67aa-8988-1197-ed1093b2ad28.md "Direction Property") | A vector specifying the direction of the constraint. The direction is fixed, and the shape is always constructed so that the segment direction has a positive dot product with this vector. |
| [IsValidObject](11bccb40-f634-003a-439b-88308d41d04f.md "IsValidObject Property") | Specifies whether the .NET object represents a valid Revit entity.  (Inherited from [RebarShapeConstraint](21c642f3-7aae-759b-4aac-ff4e2dd77d57.md "RebarShapeConstraint Class").) |
| [TripleProductSign](328f466e-e8f3-f393-968e-75ca63c9d441.md "TripleProductSign Property") | Sign of the z-coordinate of the cross product of the Direction property with the segment vector. TripleProductSign is 1 if the segment direction is to be on the left of the constraint direction, or -1 if the segment direction is to be on the right. |
