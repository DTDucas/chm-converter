The relationship between lower level or upper level and the MassZone. The MassZone is not intersected by this level, this level just happens to be the nearest upper or lower level. The MassZone was created by cutting its source geometry with this level. The level cuts through the MassZone geometry. One or more faces of the MassZone are coincident with this level and the level does not otherwise cut through or intersect the MassZone geometry.
