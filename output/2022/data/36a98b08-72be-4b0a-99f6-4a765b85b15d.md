# ### Return Value
The crop boundaries. 
# Remarks
This method returns a representation of the boundaries of the currently active crop for the associated view. If the view crop has a non-rectangular shape, the method returns that shape. Otherwise, if the view crop has been split, the method returns the multiple rectangular boundaries visible in the crop - note that this does not reflect any offsets that may have been applied to the boundary regions. If the crop is not split, this returns a single rectangle representing the crop. All coordinates are in the coordinate frame of the view.
