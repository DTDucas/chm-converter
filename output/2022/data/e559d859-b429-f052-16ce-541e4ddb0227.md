# ### Return Value
True if the transaction group has already been committed or rolled back, False otherwise. 
# Remarks
A transaction is ended by completing either the [Commit](11878443-43f2-63fb-a95d-baa1eeab776d.md "Commit Method") or [RollBack](2efcf628-bb40-bf36-a2e4-eaeca4cca461.md "RollBack Method") or [Assimilate](158471e4-5554-16ed-f9bf-f7499b86309c.md "Assimilate Method") method. Another way of testing whether a transaction group has ended is by testing its current status returned from (see [GetStatus()()()()](80db1b02-e36c-1c4e-1788-fd92b0d20a1f.md "GetStatus Method")). It must be either 'TransactionStatus.Committed' or 'TransactionStatus.RolledBack'
