# ### Parameters
document
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..Document](db03274b-a107-aa32-9034-f3e0df4bb1ec.md "Document Class") The document in which the RevisionCloud should be created. 
view
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..View](fb92a4e7-f3a7-ef14-e631-342179b18de9.md "View Class") The View in which the RevisionCloud should appear. 
revisionId
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..ElementId](44f3f7b1-3229-3404-93c9-dc5e70337dd6.md "ElementId Class") The Revision to associate with the new RevisionCloud. 
curves
    Type: System.Collections.Generic..::..IList<(Of <(<'[Curve](400cc9b6-9ff7-de85-6fd8-c20002209d25.md "Curve Class")>)>)> The curves that will form the RevisionCloud's sketch. 
# ### Return Value
The newly created RevisionCloud. 
# Remarks
Creates a new RevisionCloud in the specified View. The new RevisionCloud will be associated with the specified Revision. RevisionClouds can only be created if the Revision has not yet been issued. 
RevisionClouds can be created in most graphical Views, excepting 3D views and graphical column schedules. Unlike most other Elements, RevisionClouds can be created directly on a ViewSheet.
RevisionClouds are created based on a series of sketched curves. There is no requirement that the curves form closed loops and self-intersections are also permitted. The curves will be automatically projected onto the appropriate plane for the View. The list of curves cannot be empty and any lines cannot be perpendicular to the View's plane. If the View is a model View, the coordinates specified for the curves will be interpreted in model space. If the View is a non-model View (such as a ViewSheet) then the coordinates will be interpreted in the View's space.
The cloud graphics will be attached to the curves under the assumption that each curve is oriented in a clockwise direction. For lines, this means that the outside of the cloud is in the direction of the line's normal vector within the View's plane. Any closed loops should therefore be oriented clockwise to create the typical cloud shape.
# Examples
CopyC#
```text
private void CreateRevisionCloudInActiveView(Document document, Revision revision, IList<Curve> curves)
{
    using (Transaction newRevisionCloud = new Transaction(document, "Create Revision Cloud"))
    {
        newRevisionCloud.Start();
        // Can only create revision cloud for revision that is not issued
        if (revision.Issued == false)
        {
            RevisionCloud.Create(document, document.ActiveView, revision.Id, curves);
            newRevisionCloud.Commit();
        }
        else
        {
            newRevisionCloud.RollBack();
        }
    }
}
```

CopyVB.NET
```text
Private Sub CreateRevisionCloudInActiveView(document As Document, revision As Revision, curves As IList(Of Curve))
    Using newRevisionCloud As New Transaction(document, "Create Revision Cloud")
        newRevisionCloud.Start()
        ' Can only create revision cloud for revision that is not issued
        If revision.Issued = False Then
            RevisionCloud.Create(document, document.ActiveView, revision.Id, curves)
            newRevisionCloud.Commit()
        Else
            newRevisionCloud.RollBack()
        End If
    End Using
End Sub
