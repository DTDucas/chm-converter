# Remarks
This filter is a quick filter. Quick filters operate only on the ElementRecord, a low-memory class which has a limited interface to read element properties. Elements which are rejected by a quick filter will not be expanded in memory.
Note that it may be faster to get a list of symbol ids from [GetFamilySymbolIds()()()()](8989a269-c516-0ace-5365-864a61df1103.md "GetFamilySymbolIds Method") rather than to iterate all of the contents of a document with this filter applied.
