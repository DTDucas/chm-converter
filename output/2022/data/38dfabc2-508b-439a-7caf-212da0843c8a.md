The [MeshFromGeometryOperationResult](acca9a2a-6d1d-efd3-3838-218e2a94f52a.md "MeshFromGeometryOperationResult Class") type exposes the following members.
# Methods
| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Dispose](1232a220-124f-f1ed-adcf-9234bf17e2ed.md "Dispose Method") | Releases all resources used by the [MeshFromGeometryOperationResult](acca9a2a-6d1d-efd3-3838-218e2a94f52a.md "MeshFromGeometryOperationResult Class") |
| Equals | Determines whether the specified Object is equal to the current Object. (Inherited from Object.) |
| GetHashCode | Serves as a hash function for a particular type.  (Inherited from Object.) |
| [GetIssues](0a0dded2-d7d7-9d7e-424d-ffb09051a690.md "GetIssues Method") | Returns the array of issues encountered while building a mesh. |
| [GetMesh](bd2901fe-9510-612a-f383-cb8caaee62ed.md "GetMesh Method") | This returns a valid mesh only for the first call. Later calls will throw an exception as the mesh is no longer valid in this object. |
| GetType | Gets the Type of the current instance. (Inherited from Object.) |
| ToString | Returns a string that represents the current object. (Inherited from Object.) |

# Properties
| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [HasInvalidData](2ceba862-dbcf-348e-4aec-9e676a093d60.md "HasInvalidData Property") | Whether the provided data for which this result was obtained were internally inconsistent and could not be used in its entirety. For example, for extrusion operation, profile loops were degenerate or improperly oriented with respect to the extrsuion direction. |
| [IsMeshAvailable](9d587518-ed0c-5199-47b3-2f3c0fa69cb8.md "IsMeshAvailable Property") | Shows whether the result still contains the mesh which was constructed, if any, or whether it has been relinquished by 'getMesh'. The former is true, the later is false. |
| [IsValidObject](fff8becb-ceed-55e1-3977-8ea49762b48b.md "IsValidObject Property") | Specifies whether the .NET object represents a valid Revit entity. |
| [Tessellated](30d4e459-7217-20bd-9192-b5253ea78792.md "Tessellated Property") | Whether while constructing a mesh, it was necessary to extrude polylines instead of non-linear curves from the profile loops. |
