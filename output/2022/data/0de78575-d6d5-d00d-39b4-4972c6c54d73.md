# Methods
| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Create](fc1bff98-15ce-be6e-5a23-89e20aad9e1d.md "Create Method") | Creates a conical surface defined by a local reference frame and a half angle. |
| [Dispose](c9ee1344-bc19-d833-52e7-dcc4931fe085.md "Dispose Method") | (Inherited from [Surface](bb391358-5ca0-578d-e8e2-6d1b30c472d8.md "Surface Class").) |
| Equals | Determines whether the specified Object is equal to the current Object. (Inherited from Object.) |
| [GetBoundingBoxUV](5084214f-219f-780f-fe03-f16b62b2660d.md "GetBoundingBoxUV Method") | Gets the UV bounding box of the surface.  (Inherited from [Surface](bb391358-5ca0-578d-e8e2-6d1b30c472d8.md "Surface Class").) |
| [GetFrameOfReference](59ae1045-6128-4daa-ca37-db36309d9905.md "GetFrameOfReference Method") | Returns frame of reference associated with this ConicalSurface. |
| GetHashCode | Serves as a hash function for a particular type.  (Inherited from Object.) |
| GetType | Gets the Type of the current instance. (Inherited from Object.) |
| [IsValidConeAngle](33f4d39f-a8b1-ef85-d423-fdc5044b8253.md "IsValidConeAngle Method") | Checks whether the input value lies is not 0, greater than -PI/2 and lesser than PI/2. |
| [Project](802cc09b-d0a4-dfc5-8ca1-e8c5e8cd4ced.md "Project Method") | Project a 3D point orthogonally onto a surface (to find the nearest point). Throws InvalidOperationException if the projection fails.  (Inherited from [Surface](bb391358-5ca0-578d-e8e2-6d1b30c472d8.md "Surface Class").) |
| [ProjectWithGuessPoint](db8cc42a-9f34-611a-d9c5-852f3935887f.md "ProjectWithGuessPoint Method") | Project a 3D point orthogonally onto a surface (to find the nearest point). This method is meant to be used when a good approximate solution for the projection is available. Throws InvalidOperationException if the projection fails.  (Inherited from [Surface](bb391358-5ca0-578d-e8e2-6d1b30c472d8.md "Surface Class").) |
| ToString | Returns a string that represents the current object. (Inherited from Object.) |
