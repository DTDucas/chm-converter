# ### Parameters
path
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..ModelPath](40a84c72-e4b8-72ac-2f71-3216c66a11b3.md "ModelPath Class") Name and path to be saved as. For a file path, either a relative or absolute path can be provided. 
options
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..SaveAsOptions](f8eecf56-8b25-4140-d66e-c87f0d664ee1.md "SaveAsOptions Class") Options to govern the SaveAs operation. 
# Remarks
This method may not be called unless all transactions, sub-transactions, and transaction groups that were opened by the API code were closed. That also implies that this method cannot be called during dynamic updates. Event handlers are not allowed to save document that are currently in modifiable state.
If options.rename is true, then the document's title in Revit's title bar will be updated automatically to reflect the file's new name.
