# ### Parameters
type
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..FailureResolutionType](786e6422-f66d-5320-99f9-e530819e50a1.md "FailureResolutionType Enumeration") Type of the resolution to add. The type of resolution can be used only once for the FailureDefinition. 
caption
    Type: System..::..String A simple description of the resolution. 
classOfResolution
    Type: System..::..Type The runtime class of the resolution. Used to ensure that the actual FailureResoution object added to the instance of FailureMessage belongs to an applicable class. 
# ### Return Value
The FailureDefinition. 
# Remarks
In order to inform Revit what failure resolutions can be possibly used with a given failure, a FailureDefinition must contain a full list of resolution types applicable to the failure, including user-visible caption and runtime class of the resolution. The number of resolutions is not limited. The first added resolution becomes the default resolution.
