| MaximumSpacing | The maximum distance between rebar is specified by input, and the number of rebar changes based on the length of rebar set. |
| NumberWithSpacing | Both the spacing between rebar and the number of rebar are constant based on input. |
| MinimumClearSpacing | The minimum distance between rebar is specified by input, and the number of rebar changes based on the length of rebar set. This spacing is maintained even if the rebar size changes. |
