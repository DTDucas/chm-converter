[Document Class](db03274b-a107-aa32-9034-f3e0df4bb1ec.md "Document Class") Example See Also

Updates the elements in the Revit document to reflect all changes.
**Namespace:** [Autodesk.Revit.DB](87546ba7-461b-c646-cbb1-2cb8f5bff8b2.md "Autodesk.Revit.DB Namespace")**Assembly:** RevitAPI (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 22.0.0.0 (22.1.0.0)
# Syntax
C#  
---  
```text
public void Regenerate()
```
  
Visual Basic  
---  
```text
Public Sub Regenerate
```
  
Visual C++  
---  
```text
public:
void Regenerate()
```
  
# Remarks
Use this method to force update to the document after a group of changes. Note that when a transaction is committed there is an automatic call to regenerate the document.
# Examples
CopyC#
```text
FamilyInstance instance = doc.Create.NewFamilyInstance(new XYZ(15, 20, 0), familySymbol, StructuralType.NonStructural);
FamilyInstance instance2 = doc.Create.NewFamilyInstance(new XYZ(25, 30, 0), familySymbol, StructuralType.NonStructural);
// faster to create multiple instances without calling Regenerate after each one

LocationPoint point = instance.Location as LocationPoint;
// this data is incorrect because the new geometry has not yet been regenerated

doc.Regenerate();
point = instance.Location as LocationPoint;
// now it is correct
```

CopyVB.NET
```text
Dim instance As FamilyInstance = doc.Create.NewFamilyInstance(New XYZ(15, 20, 0), familySymbol, StructuralType.NonStructural)
Dim instance2 As FamilyInstance = doc.Create.NewFamilyInstance(New XYZ(25, 30, 0), familySymbol, StructuralType.NonStructural)
' faster to create multiple instances without calling Regenerate after each one

Dim point As LocationPoint = TryCast(instance.Location, LocationPoint)
' this data is incorrect because the new geometry has not yet been regenerated

doc.Regenerate()
point = TryCast(instance.Location, LocationPoint)
' now it is correct
```

# Exceptions
| Exception | Condition |
| --- | --- |
| --- | --- |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions..::..RegenerationFailedException](787bb389-74c2-5ce7-cdd6-32211209ded2.md "RegenerationFailedException Class") | Thrown when the operation fails. |

  * If regeneration fails, there is posted error of severity DocumentCorruption that will be delivered to the end user at the end of transaction explaining what specifically has happened. 
  * If regeneration has failed, document is corrupted and even reading from it is illegal.
  * Code that called regeneration and got this exception should not catch and ignore it - instead, it should do nothing but internal cleanup and return control to the owner of currently active transaction/subtransaction, which must be aborted.

  
[Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions..::..InvalidOperationException](9e715f03-3884-e539-4dd6-8d7545733adc.md "InvalidOperationException Class")| Modification of the document is forbidden. Typically, this is because there is no open transaction; consult documentation for Document.IsModified for other possible causes.
