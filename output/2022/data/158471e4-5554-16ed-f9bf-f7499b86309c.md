TransactionGroup..::..Assimilate Method   
[TransactionGroup Class](f1113d30-4c36-7844-1537-aad7f095cea0.md "TransactionGroup Class") Example See Also  
---  
Assimilates all inner transactions by merging them into a single undo item. 
**Namespace:** [Autodesk.Revit.DB](87546ba7-461b-c646-cbb1-2cb8f5bff8b2.md "Autodesk.Revit.DB Namespace")**Assembly:** RevitAPI (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 22.0.0.0 (22.1.0.0)**Since:** 2011 
# Syntax
C#

```text
public TransactionStatus Assimilate()
```
  
Visual Basic

```text
Public Function Assimilate As TransactionStatus
```
  
Visual C++

```text
public:
TransactionStatus Assimilate()
```
  
# ### Return Value
If finished successfully, this method returns TransactionStatus.Committed. 
# Remarks
After a successful assimilation the transaction group is committed.
All transactions committed inside this group will be merged into one single transaction. The resulting undo item will bear this group's name.
Assimilate can be called only when all inner transaction groups and transactions are finished, i.e. after they were either committed or rolled back.
# Examples
CopyC#
```text
public void CompoundOperation(Autodesk.Revit.DB.Document document)
{
   // All and any transaction group should be enclosed in a 'using' block or guarded within 
   // a try-catch-finally blocks to guarantee that the group does not out-live its scope.
   using (TransactionGroup transGroup = new TransactionGroup(document, "Level and Grid"))
    {
       if (transGroup.Start() == TransactionStatus.Started)
       {
          // We are going to call two methods, each having its own local transaction.
          // For our compound operation to be considered successful, both the individual
          // transactions must succeed. If either one fails, we will roll our group back,
          // regardless of what transactions might have already been committed.

          if (CreateLevel(document, 25.0) && CreateGrid(document, new XYZ(0,0,0), new XYZ(10,0,0)))
          {
             // The process of assimilating will merge the two (or any number of) committed
             // transaction together and will assign the grid's name to the one resulting transaction,
             // which will become the only item from this compound operation appearing in the undo menu.
             transGroup.Assimilate();
          }
          else
          {
             // Since we could not successfully finish at least one of the individual
             // operation, we are going to roll the entire group back, which will
             // undo any transaction already committed while this group was open.
             transGroup.RollBack();
          }
       }
