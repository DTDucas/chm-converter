# Constructors
| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [TessellatedShapeBuilder](2018769c-6575-1926-7978-539291b3ff8b.md "TessellatedShapeBuilder Constructor") | Constructs a new instance of a TessellatedShapeBuilder. |

# Methods
| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [AddFace](401c4066-4ec1-be8c-53ae-daea44f3244d.md "AddFace Method") | Adds a face to the currently open connected face set. |
| [AreTargetAndFallbackCompatible](fc565805-bda1-2cd3-6bf0-e0defa4edfc9.md "AreTargetAndFallbackCompatible Method") | Checks whether this combination of fallback and target parameters can be used as a valid combination of inputs. |
| [Build](3b67078d-f8fd-83f4-ee2e-b83e8ec23a23.md "Build Method") | Builds the designated geometrical objects from the stored face sets. Stores the result in this TessellatedShapeBuilder object. |
| [CancelConnectedFaceSet](11a71aab-1685-27ad-10c4-328e4a02b4fb.md "CancelConnectedFaceSet Method") | Cancels the current face set - i.e., all data from it will be lost and the builder will have no open connected face set anymore. |
| [Clear](8c2cd942-f8c3-3288-bac6-8d4d1f064714.md "Clear Method") | Erases all face set and clears the logs, if any. |
| [CloseConnectedFaceSet](0bebb71c-317e-3dbc-1304-169561e22214.md "CloseConnectedFaceSet Method") | Closes the currently open connected face set. |
| [CreateMeshByExtrusion](16bfff9e-b581-94b8-4797-cb880d79e793.md "CreateMeshByExtrusion Method") | Builds a mesh by extruding curve loop(s) along extrusion distance. |
| [Dispose](efbfadf8-519d-7f66-8553-e887ed3058f1.md "Dispose Method") | (Inherited from [ShapeBuilder](66c1678c-2e01-e0de-1386-5a0e1eb3ccff.md "ShapeBuilder Class").) |
| [DoesFaceHaveEnoughLoopsAndVertices](894594d4-e75a-843e-ed5f-c9554feec2f4.md "DoesFaceHaveEnoughLoopsAndVertices Method") | Checks whether 'face' has enough loops and vertcies to be valid. |
| Equals | Determines whether the specified Object is equal to the current Object. (Inherited from Object.) |
| [GetBuildResult](136e8763-4156-4ffe-0fcc-45af9dbb6c14.md "GetBuildResult Method") | Get the built geometry, build status and other data stored in TessellatedShapeBuilderResult. Clears the stored data. |
| GetHashCode | Serves as a hash function for a particular type.  (Inherited from Object.) |
| GetType | Gets the Type of the current instance. (Inherited from Object.) |
| [OpenConnectedFaceSet](186da29a-caa2-99ea-1b2a-722c1656c44a.md "OpenConnectedFaceSet Method") | Opens a new connected face set. |
| ToString | Returns a string that represents the current object. (Inherited from Object.) |

# Properties
| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Fallback](59acf1d0-742a-45eb-df1c-edbb136279a4.md "Fallback Property") | Defines acceptable fallback if the desired type of geometry can't be built. |
| [GraphicsStyleId](b52fe304-95a0-77c8-4b4c-e3c18c16677d.md "GraphicsStyleId Property") | Optional - if set, the built geometry will use that graphics style. |
| [IsFaceSetOpen](0da2193e-aebc-5eb4-353e-ea72a12868bc.md "IsFaceSetOpen Property") | Flag whether the current set of connected faces is open and additional tessellation faces can be added to it. |
| [IsValidObject](6a5c7474-6ea6-4886-d356-204405406596.md "IsValidObject Property") | Specifies whether the .NET object represents a valid Revit entity.  (Inherited from [ShapeBuilder](66c1678c-2e01-e0de-1386-5a0e1eb3ccff.md "ShapeBuilder Class").) |
| [LogInteger](c6a84d2a-824d-07e9-4559-79bb80d25e8e.md "LogInteger Property") | Integer value used for logging, if it is performed. Usually the number of the face set(s) in the IFC file, from which they are imported. Any value is acceptable. |
| [LogString](dbfa746b-807f-d58a-cd1c-67ff07f4b968.md "LogString Property") | String used for logging, if any. Usually the name of the file from which face sets were imported. |
| [NumberOfCompletedFaceSets](aacc351c-0e65-7d1d-c177-627de5e9974a.md "NumberOfCompletedFaceSets Property") | Number of completed face sets. |
| [OwnerInfo](5c2c3e95-ae6e-f303-a770-662acf186181.md "OwnerInfo Property") | String used for logging, if any. Usually describes the element or object, which either defined or will own the geoemtrical objects to be built. |
| [Target](2e6f38a0-cabd-5fac-34dc-40af993135c7.md "Target Property") | Requests the type of geometry to be built. |
