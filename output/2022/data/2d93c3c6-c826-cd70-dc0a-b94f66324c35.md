This method is called at the very start of the export process, still before the first entity of the model was send out.

# ### Return Value
Return True if you are ready to proceed with processing the export. 
# Examples

// A context would typically maintain a variable for the document being exported
private Document m_document = null;

// Some contexts may find it useful to have a flag indicating
// whether or not the process should be canceled (see Is
private bool m_cancelled = false;

// Typically, an export context has to manage a stack of transformation
// for all nested objects, such as instances, lights, links, etc.
private Stack<Transform> m_TransformationStack = new Stack<Transform>();

/// <summary>
/// Assuming that instance variables gets initiated in the context's constructor
/// </summary>
/// <param name="document"></param>

{
   m_document = document;
   m_TransformationStack.Push(Transform.Identity);
