# Remarks
Rebar host elements keep track of the "exposed faces," those that are not completely concealed by another rebar host. Faces may be concealed by joins; for instance, the top face of a beam that supports a slab is concealed. Faces can also be concealed by adjacency; for instance, the bottom face of a column that is supported by a foundation. Each exposed face of a rebar host must have a valid CoverType associated with it.
Rebar hosts also have cover parameters, providing a limited interface to the [GetCoverType](4d952f72-42b5-88f1-0788-7e64ff6589bb.md "GetCoverType Method") and [SetCoverType](58674efc-3bf7-d999-78c8-3a490bb601f0.md "SetCoverType Method") methods. Each parameter simply gets or sets the cover setting associated with one or more particular faces of the host.
