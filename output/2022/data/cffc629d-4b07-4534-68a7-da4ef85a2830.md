The [RebarShapeConstraintProjectedSegmentLength](a41486b4-25c4-c955-f1ab-c585ffb92bd2.md "RebarShapeConstraintProjectedSegmentLength Class") type exposes the following members.
# Constructors
| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [RebarShapeConstraintProjectedSegmentLength](99ce7f5e-aa7d-479c-db28-ac76699f5c72.md "RebarShapeConstraintProjectedSegmentLength Constructor") | Constructs a new instance of a RebarConstraintProjectEdgedLength object using a shape parameter, direction, and reference types. |

# Methods
| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Dispose](80be3c21-c088-51c7-7d4a-8df7a2554062.md "Dispose Method") | (Inherited from [RebarShapeConstraint](21c642f3-7aae-759b-4aac-ff4e2dd77d57.md "RebarShapeConstraint Class").) |
| Equals | Determines whether the specified Object is equal to the current Object. (Inherited from Object.) |
| GetHashCode | Serves as a hash function for a particular type.  (Inherited from Object.) |
| [GetParamId](bfb42a51-8d55-41f3-aea9-21f60b228923.md "GetParamId Method") | Return the Id of the parameter associated with this constraint.  (Inherited from [RebarShapeConstraint](21c642f3-7aae-759b-4aac-ff4e2dd77d57.md "RebarShapeConstraint Class").) |
| [GetSegmentEndReferenceType](b97eb2c5-4cbc-6229-e0c6-968037f007ff.md "GetSegmentEndReferenceType Method") | Choice of two possibilities for the start and end references of the length constraint. |
| GetType | Gets the Type of the current instance. (Inherited from Object.) |
| ToString | Returns a string that represents the current object. (Inherited from Object.) |

# Properties
| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Direction](ac104515-67aa-8988-1197-ed1093b2ad28.md "Direction Property") | A vector specifying the direction of the constraint. The direction is fixed, and the shape is always constructed so that the segment direction has a positive dot product with this vector. |
| [IsValidObject](11bccb40-f634-003a-439b-88308d41d04f.md "IsValidObject Property") | Specifies whether the .NET object represents a valid Revit entity.  (Inherited from [RebarShapeConstraint](21c642f3-7aae-759b-4aac-ff4e2dd77d57.md "RebarShapeConstraint Class").) |
| [TripleProductSign](328f466e-e8f3-f393-968e-75ca63c9d441.md "TripleProductSign Property") | Sign of the z-coordinate of the cross product of the Direction property with the segment vector. TripleProductSign is 1 if the segment direction is to be on the left of the constraint direction, or -1 if the segment direction is to be on the right. |
