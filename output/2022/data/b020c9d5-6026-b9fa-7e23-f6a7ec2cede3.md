# ### Parameters
doc
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..Document](db03274b-a107-aa32-9034-f3e0df4bb1ec.md "Document Class") A document. 
style
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB.Structure..::..RebarStyle](a9ac65a6-29e6-25e5-caca-502e21385f47.md "RebarStyle Enumeration") The usage of the bar, "standard" or "stirrup/tie". 
barType
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB.Structure..::..RebarBarType](467b44cc-54e7-3ecf-07e1-ad15d05fe800.md "RebarBarType Class") A RebarBarType element that defines bar diameter, bend radius and material of the rebar. 
startHook
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB.Structure..::..RebarHookType](3c7a78d5-f92b-e58b-e7c9-7927537498fd.md "RebarHookType Class") A RebarHookType element that defines the hook for the start of the bar. If this parameter is nullNothingnullptra null reference (Nothing in Visual Basic), it means to create a rebar with no hook. 
endHook
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB.Structure..::..RebarHookType](3c7a78d5-f92b-e58b-e7c9-7927537498fd.md "RebarHookType Class") A RebarHookType element that defines the hook for the end of the bar. If this parameter is nullNothingnullptra null reference (Nothing in Visual Basic), it means to create a rebar with no hook. 
host
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..Element](eb16114f-69ea-f4de-0d0d-f7388b105a16.md "Element Class") The element to which the rebar belongs. The element must support rebar hosting; [!:Autodesk::Revit::DB::Structure::RebarHostData]. 
norm
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..XYZ](c2fd995c-95c0-58fb-f5de-f3246cbc5600.md "XYZ Class") The normal to the plane that the rebar curves lie on. 
curves
    Type: System.Collections.Generic..::..IList<(Of <(<'[Curve](400cc9b6-9ff7-de85-6fd8-c20002209d25.md "Curve Class")>)>)> An array of curves that define the shape of the rebar curves. They must belong to the plane defined by the normal and origin. Bends and hooks should not be included in the array of curves. 
startHookOrient
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB.Structure..::..RebarHookOrientation](e8365754-0811-8d4e-864a-55bf34af3a87.md "RebarHookOrientation Enumeration") Defines the orientation of the hook plane at the start of the rebar with respect to the orientation of the first curve and the plane normal. Only two values are permitted: Value = Right: The hook is on your right as you stand at the end of the bar, with the bar behind you, taking the bar's normal as "up." Value = Left: The hook is on your left as you stand at the end of the bar, with the bar behind you, taking the bar's normal as "up." 
endHookOrient
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB.Structure..::..RebarHookOrientation](e8365754-0811-8d4e-864a-55bf34af3a87.md "RebarHookOrientation Enumeration") Defines the orientation of the hook plane at the end of the rebar with respect to the orientation of the last curve and the plane normal. Only two values are permitted: Value = Right: The hook is on your right as you stand at the end of the bar, with the bar behind you, taking the bar's normal as "up." Value = Left: The hook is on your left as you stand at the end of the bar, with the bar behind you, taking the bar's normal as "up." 
useExistingShapeIfPossible
    Type: System..::..Boolean Attempts to assign a RebarShape from those existing in the document. If no shape matches, this function returns null if createNewShape is false or it will create a new shape if createNewShape is true. When both parameters are "true", the behavior is the same as sketching rebar in the UI. At least one of these parameters must be "true". If the RebarShapeDefinesHooks flag in ReinforcementSettings has been set to false, and a RebarShape cannot be found with both matching curves and hooks, then this method will perform a second search, ignoring hook information. 
createNewShape
    Type: System..::..Boolean Creates a shape in the document to match the curves, hooks, and style specified, and assigns it to the new rebar instance. Shape creation will not succeed unless one or more other shapes already exist in the document, and these shapes have enough shape parameters to define a shape for these curves. 
# ### Return Value
The newly created Rebar instance, or nullNothingnullptra null reference (Nothing in Visual Basic) if the operation fails.
