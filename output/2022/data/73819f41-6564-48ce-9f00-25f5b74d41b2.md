# ### Parameters
sketchId
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..ElementId](44f3f7b1-3229-3404-93c9-dc5e70337dd6.md "ElementId Class") The Sketch element to be edited. 
# Remarks
The application will need to start a transaction to actually make changes to the Sketch element. SketchEditScope can only be started when there is no transaction active, thus it does not work for commands running in automatic transaction mode. Like all Start methods in any edit scope object this too returns an Id of the element in the edit session, even though in this case here it always equals to the given sketchId.
