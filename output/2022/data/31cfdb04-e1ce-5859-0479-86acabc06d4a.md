# ### Return Value
True if it is possible to create parts from this DirectShapeType. 
# Remarks
While it is generally possible to create parts from DirectShape elements, some characteristics make parts creation impossible. This property is re-evaluated every time the DirectShapeType's geometry is modified (via a call to SetShape or AppendShape). Invalid configurations include: DirectShapeTypes containing a polymesh, or an open geometry, as well as DirectShapeTypes not containing any solids and DirectShapeTypes configured as NotReferenceable (via a call to SetOptions). Finally, if a DirectShapeType has other DirectShapeType instances in its geometry, and one of those other DirectShapeTypes has a configuration that is incompatible with parts creation, the host DirectShapeType will also be incompatible with parts creation.
