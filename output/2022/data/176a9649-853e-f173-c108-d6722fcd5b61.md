RebarShapeBendAngle Enumeration

---  
A bend in a rebar shape has an angular range specified by one of these values. The angles refer to the angle swept out by one segment as it is bent relative to another. That is, an "Obtuse" bend results in two segments that meet at an angle that is less than 90 degrees when measured internally. Put another way, to create an equilateral triangle, you would need two "Obtuse" bends.
