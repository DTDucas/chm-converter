| [CornerMullionOverlapsOtherOnePlacedOnNeighboringRegion](1d141b3c-3d3a-8c55-6b64-40ecfcc8eead.md "CornerMullionOverlapsOtherOnePlacedOnNeighboringRegion Property") | Corner Mullion overlaps Mullion placed on neighboring Curtain region. |
| [CornerMullionsNeighborsMustBeTangent](728ebd90-3245-badd-bd5a-31b96dced88c.md "CornerMullionsNeighborsMustBeTangent Property") | Corner Mullions must be placed at a location that can have neighboring Panels that are not tangent. With the exception of Wall Join locations, Corner Mullions are not currently supported on the external boundaries of Curtain elements. |

This is probably caused by two Grid Lines almost meeting at a border of the Curtain Wall or Sloped Glazing, but not exactly at a point. The Curtain Panel can't be displayed. |
| [MullionProfileContainsMoreThanOneOrOpenLoop](fd8804c5-4c3b-e347-755d-5f6e8599b60c.md "MullionProfileContainsMoreThanOneOrOpenLoop Property") | The selected mullion profile either contains more than one profile loop or an open profile loop and cannot be used.

If your panel is simple, create an appropriate panel type derived from the system panel family. If not, try making the panel in the wall or roof rectangular, and then using a panel family of the desired (non-rectangular) shape. The wall will then conform to the non-rectangular shape of the panel. |
| [PanelsSlightlyMalformedCorruption](e33713f2-3d18-516c-9b10-b768e37d972b.md "PanelsSlightlyMalformedCorruption Property") | Some panels in this curtain system are slightly malformed. The problem is most likely ignorable. This problem usually occurs when a panel or parts of a panel have been divided so that they are very narrow. To better see the malformed panels, temporarily hide the mullion category and set display of lines to ""thin lines"" (using the command on the view menu). |
