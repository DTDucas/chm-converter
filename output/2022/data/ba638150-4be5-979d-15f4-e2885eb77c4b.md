# Remarks
The type of surface is figured out depending on the source element and the number of space adjacencies. 
  * If there is no associate source element and no space adjacencies, it will have a type of Shade. If there are any space adjacencies, it will have a type of Air. 
  * If the source element is a Wall or a Curtain Wall and have one space adjacency, it will have a type of ExteriorWall. 
  * If the source element is a Wall or a Curtain Wall and have two space adjacencies, it will have a type of InteriorWall. 
  * If the source element is a Wall or a Curtain Wall and the type Function parameter is set to "Interior" or "CoreShaft", it will have a type of InteriorWall. 
  * If the source element is a Wall or a Curtain Wall and have one space adjacency and if it is below grade, it will have a type of UndergroundWall. 
  * If the source element is a Floor and have one space adjacency, it will have a type of SlabOnGrade. If the source element is above grade, it will have a type of RaisedFloor. If the source element is below grade, it will have a type of UndergroundSlab. 
  * If the source element is a Floor and have two space adjacencies, it will have a type of InteriorFloor. 
  * If the source element is a Floor and the type Function parameter is set to "Interior", it will have a type of InteriorFloor. 
  * If the source element is a Roof or a Ceiling and have one space adjacency, it will have a type of Roof. 
  * If the source element is a Roof or a Ceiling and have one space adjacency and is below grade, it will have a type of UndergroundCeiling. 
  * If the source element is a Roof or a Ceiling and have two space adjacencies, it will have a type of Ceiling.
