# Methods
| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Create](8c296707-eb09-33b6-cad8-05e1894b34f2.md "Create Method") | Construct BRepBuilderSurfaceGeometry based on a permitted Revit Surface, including Plane and CylSurf. |
| [CreateNURBSSurface(Int32, Int32, IList<(Of <<'(Double>)>>), IList<(Of <<'(Double>)>>), IList<(Of <<'(XYZ>)>>), Boolean, BoundingBoxUV)](96a6a3b6-4e18-f94c-587e-4a8345784065.md "CreateNURBSSurface Method \(Int32, Int32, IList\(Double\), IList\(Double\), IList\(XYZ\), Boolean, BoundingBoxUV\)") | Construct a BRepBuilderSurfaceGeometry based on NURBS surface data, where the weights are not supplied. In this case, the NURBS surface will be a piecewise polynomial surface. |
| [CreateNURBSSurface(Int32, Int32, IList<(Of <<'(Double>)>>), IList<(Of <<'(Double>)>>), IList<(Of <<'(XYZ>)>>), IList<(Of <<'(Double>)>>), Boolean, BoundingBoxUV)](04ce47fc-117b-8e48-c388-7f2de2bbaa96.md "CreateNURBSSurface Method \(Int32, Int32, IList\(Double\), IList\(Double\), IList\(XYZ\), IList\(Double\), Boolean, BoundingBoxUV\)") | Construct BRepBuilderSurfaceGeometry based on NURBS surface data, where the weights are supplied. In this case, the NURBS surface will be a piecewise rational polynomial surface. |
| [Dispose](39ac06f7-f595-ff9a-314d-c578b0208a9f.md "Dispose Method") | Releases all resources used by the [BRepBuilderSurfaceGeometry](c21d4101-cc15-1990-ee9f-994b487bf95d.md "BRepBuilderSurfaceGeometry Class") |
| Equals | Determines whether the specified Object is equal to the current Object. (Inherited from Object.) |
| GetHashCode | Serves as a hash function for a particular type.  (Inherited from Object.) |
| GetType | Gets the Type of the current instance. (Inherited from Object.) |
| ToString | Returns a string that represents the current object. (Inherited from Object.) |

| [IsValidObject](073f35f9-8a25-b8d7-7e75-a2e3ec8c7e0f.md "IsValidObject Property") | Specifies whether the .NET object represents a valid Revit entity. |
