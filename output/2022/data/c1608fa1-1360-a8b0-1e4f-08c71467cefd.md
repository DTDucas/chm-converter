# Remarks
This property is used to retrieve the segments that constitute the boundary of the Zone. Each Zone may have several regions, each of which have several segments hence the data is returned in the form of an array of boundary segment arrays. See the Zone.BoundarySegment object for more details about the segments that make up the Zone topology.
