# Remarks
Surface and Opening elements get an Name element assigned according to the below described schema: 
(Orientation)(Space#)[(Other space#)](Exposure)(Type)-(sequence number)[Opening Type+#]
Sample: N-101-102-E-W-O-77 
  * N = Orientation [N/NE/E/SE/S/SW/W/NW/N/T/B/X] (every surface within the sector of 22.5 degrees from the north vector gets the letter N etc) (horizontal surfaces facing upwards get the letter T for top, downwards B for bottom) (shading surfaces get the letter X for differentiation). 
  * 101 = Space number. 
  * 102 = Other space number. 
  * E = Exposure - exterior/interior/underground [E/I/U]. 
  * W = Type [W/C/R/F] (Wall, Roof, Ceiling, Floor, Shade) (every surface type has it's letter W-Wall R-Roof C-Ceiling F-Floor S-Shade). 
  * O = Opening Type [W/D/O] (Window, Door, Opening) (every opening type has it's letter W-Window D-Door O-Opening). 
  * 77 = sequence number. 

Sample surface names: 
  * N-101-E-W-84 North facing Exterior Wall #84 in space 101. 
  * N-101-E-W-84-D-1 Door #1 in North facing Exterior Wall #84 in space 101. 
  * E-101-102-I-W-92 Vertical Interior Wall #92 between space 101 and 102. 
  * T-101-E-R-141 Top facing Exterior Roof #141 in space 101. 
  * B-101-201-I-F-88 Bottom facing Interior Floor #88 between space 101 and 201. 
  * X-73 Shade #73.
