# Remarks
If the document was created in this current session and has not been saved to a file yet, it needs to be first saved using the SaveAs method instead. 
This method may not be called unless all transactions, sub-transactions, and transaction groups that were opened by the API code were closed. That also implies that this method cannot be called during dynamic updates. Event handlers are not allowed to save document that are currently in modifiable state.
