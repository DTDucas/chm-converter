Class is an application-wide singleton that performs a dual role: it is a repository of rules to run in order to detect potential performance problems as well as an access point to execute checks. 
# Examples
CopyC#
```text
//Get the name of each registered PerformanceRule and then execute all of them.
foreach (PerformanceAdviserRuleId id in PerformanceAdviser.GetPerformanceAdviser().GetAllRuleIds())
{
    string ruleName = PerformanceAdviser.GetPerformanceAdviser().GetRuleName(id);
}
PerformanceAdviser.GetPerformanceAdviser().ExecuteAllRules(document);
```

CopyVB.NET
```text
'Get the name of each registered PerformanceRule and then execute all of them.
For Each id As PerformanceAdviserRuleId In PerformanceAdviser.GetPerformanceAdviser().GetAllRuleIds()
    Dim ruleName As String = PerformanceAdviser.GetPerformanceAdviser().GetRuleName(id)
