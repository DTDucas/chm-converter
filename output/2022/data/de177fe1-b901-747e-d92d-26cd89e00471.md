ExternalServiceOptions..::..IsSelfsynchronizing Property   
[ExternalServiceOptions Class](80467d42-3f13-de3e-cd06-bf3b43afefe0.md "ExternalServiceOptions Class") See Also  
---  
Indicates whether the service's record of used services (in a particular document) can independently wary between local clients and the corresponding central model. It is then up to the service's owner to assure proper local-central synchronization.

# Remarks
This property is ignored unless the service is also recordable.
Declaring a service as self-synchronizing makes the service bypass standard worksharing checks during local-central synchronizations. What it means is that should there be any disparity found between the list of servers used in the local file and those used in the central file, they would get ignored; it would be assumed that the owner of the service takes other steps to ensure the local and the central data are in sync.
Few services should need to set this property as True, for self-synchronizing services are very rare, practically limited only to those which operate on element level.
