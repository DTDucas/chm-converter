# ### Parameters
curve
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..Curve](400cc9b6-9ff7-de85-6fd8-c20002209d25.md "Curve Class")The specified curve to intersect with this curve.
# ### Return Value
  * SetComparisonResult.Overlap - One or more intersections were encountered. 
  * SetComparisonResult.Subset - The inputs are parallel lines with only one common intersection point, or the curve used to invoke the intersection check is a line entirely within the unbound line passed as argument curve.
  * SetComparisonResult.Superset - The input curve is entirely within the unbound line used to invoke the intersection check.
  * SetComparisonResult.Disjoint - There is no intersection found between the two curves.
  * SetComparisonResult.Equal - The two curves are identical.
