# ### Parameters
document
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..Document](db03274b-a107-aa32-9034-f3e0df4bb1ec.md "Document Class") The document. 
connector1
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..Connector](11e07082-b3f2-26a1-de79-16535f44716c.md "Connector Class") The end connector of the first placeholder. 
connector2
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..Connector](11e07082-b3f2-26a1-de79-16535f44716c.md "Connector Class") The end connector of the second placeholder. 
connector3
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..Connector](11e07082-b3f2-26a1-de79-16535f44716c.md "Connector Class") The end connector of the third placeholder. 
connector4
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..Connector](11e07082-b3f2-26a1-de79-16535f44716c.md "Connector Class") The end connector of the fourth placeholder. 
# ### Return Value
True if connection succeeds, false otherwise. 
# Remarks
The placeholders may or may not have physical connection. However: 
  * The ends of four connectors should intersect at same point.
  * The first and second placeholders should be collinear each other.
  * The third and fourth placeholders should be collinear each other.
  * The third and fourth should have intersection with first or second placeholder.

If connection fails, the placeholders cannot be physically connected.
