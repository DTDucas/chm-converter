A base class for an application-specific logger. It should be used to track errors during conversion and/or , track conversion progress, cancel a conversion process if necessary. Implementing a logger class is optional, but highly recommended for all but most basic data converters. The base class is UI- and language-independent. It is up to the using app to implement UI. Language-specifc data may be used to communicate information to application users. English should be used to communicate data of interest to Revit development.
