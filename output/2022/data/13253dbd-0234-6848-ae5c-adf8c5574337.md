The [BRepBuilderEdgeGeometry](b0051e1b-8b8b-f819-78c2-67053dd7a241.md "BRepBuilderEdgeGeometry Class") type exposes the following members.
# Methods
| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Create(Curve)](da8be410-f630-3384-e203-32b81cd0e90c.md "Create Method \(Curve\)") | Construct BRepBuilderEdgeGeometry based on any GCurve, including GLine and GArc. The curve will be simplified if possible, and the concrete type of the returned value will reflect that simplification: BRepBuilderLinearEdgeGeometry if the curve could be simplified to a line, BRepBuilderArcEdgeGeometry if it could be simplified to an arc, BRepBuilderGenericCurveEdgeGeometry otherwise. |
| [Create(XYZ, XYZ)](f2d295f0-1ff9-a8c4-d723-6e521fcbab9c.md "Create Method \(XYZ, XYZ\)") | Constructs a BRepBuilderEdgeGeometry representing a straight line between the two given points. |
| [Dispose](4ad68cf2-e2e4-b69a-bbfa-bf7f84980c86.md "Dispose Method") |
| Equals | Determines whether the specified Object is equal to the current Object. (Inherited from Object.) |
| GetHashCode | Serves as a hash function for a particular type.  (Inherited from Object.) |
| GetType | Gets the Type of the current instance. (Inherited from Object.) |
| ToString | Returns a string that represents the current object. (Inherited from Object.) |
