| BadShellOrder | Layer Function Priorities ascend from the Core Boundary to the Finish Face. |
| CoreTooThin | Core contain a membrane layer or thickness of core is zero. |
| MembraneTooThick | Thickness of membrane layer is more than zero. |
| NonmembraneTooThin | Thickness of non-membrane layer is too thin. |
| BadShellsStructure | The number of shell layers is larger than the total number of layers. |
| ThinOuterLayer | Thickness of face layer is too thin. |
| VerticalUnusedLayer | A layer is not membrane layer and the Thickness of layer is zero. |
| VerticalWrongOrderLayer | Layers assigned to the same Row are not on the same side of the Core Boundary. |
| VerticalWrongOrderCoreExterior | Exterior core boundary have more than one face at any height. |
| VerticalWrongOrderCoreInterior | Interior core boundary have more than one face at any height. |
| VerticalWrongOrderMembrane | Membrane Layer have more than one face at any height. |
| DeckCantBoundAbove | There is no layer above Structural deck or it is too thin. |
| DeckCantBoundBelow | There is no layer below Structural deck or it is too thin. |
| VarThickLayerCantBeZero | Variable thickness layer have zero thickness. |
| InvalidMaterialId | Element id used as material id does not correspond to an actual MaterialElem. |
| ExtensibleRegionsNotContiguousAlongTop | Extension Layers at the top of the wall must be adjacent. |
| ExtensibleRegionsNotContiguousAlongBottom | Extension Layers at the bottom of the wall must be adjacent. |
| InvalidProfileId | Element id used as profile id does not correspond to a valid deck profile. |
