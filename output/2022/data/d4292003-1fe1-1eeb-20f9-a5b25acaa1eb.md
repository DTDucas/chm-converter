# Syntax
C#  
---  
```text
public double TopElevation { get; set; }
```
  
Visual Basic  
---  
```text
Public Property TopElevation As Double
	Get
	Set
```
  
Visual C++  
---  
```text
public:
property double TopElevation {
	double get ();
	void set (double value);
}
```
  
# Remarks
The top elevation has following restrictions: 
  * The top elevation is relative to the base elevation of the stairs to which the stairs run belongs.
  * When setting this property the value will be rounded automatically to a multiple of the riser height.
  * When setting this property for common run, the run's height will change according to the new base/top elevation. So the value must be greater than base elevation to keep run valid.
  * When setting this property for sketched run, whose height is fixed, the run's base elevation will be adjusted to keep the same run height.
