# Remarks
The value is an integer number in range of [0,15] (inclusive), or a value {-1}. If the value is positive, Revit will use the suggested level of detail when tessellating faces; otherwise it will use its default algorithm, which is based on output resolution. 
If an explicit level of detail is requested (i.e. a positive value), using a value close to the middle of the valid range yields a very reasonable tessellation. Revit uses level 8 as its 'normal' LoD.
