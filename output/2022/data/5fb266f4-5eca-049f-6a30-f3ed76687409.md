[Transaction Class](308ebf8d-d96d-4643-cd1d-34fffcea53fd.md "Transaction Class") Example See Also  
---  
Starts the transaction with an assigned name. 
**Namespace:** [Autodesk.Revit.DB](87546ba7-461b-c646-cbb1-2cb8f5bff8b2.md "Autodesk.Revit.DB Namespace")**Assembly:** RevitAPI (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 22.0.0.0 (22.1.0.0)
# Syntax
C#  
---  
```text
public TransactionStatus Start(
	string name
)
```
  
Visual Basic  
---  
```text
Public Function Start ( _
	name As String _
) As TransactionStatus
```
  
Visual C++  
---  
```text
public:
TransactionStatus Start(
	String^ name
)
```
  
# ### Parameters
name
    Type: System..::..String Name of the transaction; If the transaction already has name, this new one will preplace it. The name will appear on the Undo menu in Revit if the transaction is successfully committed. 
# ### Return Value
If finished successfully, this method returns TransactionStatus.Started. Note that unless starting is successful, changes cannot be made to the document. 
# Remarks
A transaction may be started only after it was instantiated or after it was previously committed or rolled back.
Be aware that every time a transaction starts, [Failure Handling Options](c03bb2e5-f679-bf24-4e87-08b3c3a08385.md "FailureHandlingOptions Class") will be reset to their default values. If a specific failure handling is required, programmers need to use [SetFailureHandlingOptions(FailureHandlingOptions)](1e913cca-f75b-8dfb-b172-5a04f3732b85.md "SetFailureHandlingOptions Method") before the transaction is committed or rolled back.
# Examples
CopyC#
```text
public bool TransactionBoundaries(Autodesk.Revit.DB.Document document)
{
    bool result = false;

    // All and any transaction should be enclosed in a 'using'
    // block or guarded within a try-catch-finally blocks
    // to guarantee that a transaction does not out-live its scope.
    using (Transaction transaction = new Transaction(document))
    {
       transaction.Start("Transaction name");

       // some modification of the document here, likely resulting in 
       // changes of the 'result' value
       // ..... 

       if (result == true)
       {
          // Modifications ended successfully, but it is still possible
          // for the transaction to fail due to model regeneration
          // (and other internal processes that validate the model)
          if (TransactionStatus.Committed != transaction.Commit())
          {
             result = false;
          }
       }
       else  // if modifications failed, transaction is to be rolled back
       {
          transaction.RollBack();
       }
    }
    return result;
}

No transaction operations are permitted until failure handling is finished. -or- The transaction started already and has not been completed yet. -or- Starting a new transaction is not permitted. It could be because another transaction already started and has not been completed yet, or the document is in a state in which it cannot start a new transaction (e.g. during failure handling or a read-only mode, which could be either permanent or temporary). |
