# Methods
| Name | Description |

| [Dispose](c6fe4067-905b-9f4a-7403-ec7ee52a5ca7.md "Dispose Method") | Releases all resources used by the [TessellatedShapeBuilderResult](16e1e032-d9fd-2708-0704-ed00b0b85441.md "TessellatedShapeBuilderResult Class") |
| Equals | Determines whether the specified Object is equal to the current Object. (Inherited from Object.) |
| [GetGeometricalObjects](3c5c4efb-8960-869f-76c0-338979e5a484.md "GetGeometricalObjects Method") | When called the first time, returns geometrical objects which were built. Later calls will throw exceptions. |
| GetHashCode | Serves as a hash function for a particular type.  (Inherited from Object.) |
| [GetIssuesForFaceSet](9063460c-2dd8-a00e-6519-8733117870cb.md "GetIssuesForFaceSet Method") | Returns the array of issues encountered while processing a face set with index 'setIndex'. |
| [GetNumberOfFaceSets](c5e36953-ef39-f868-f49b-313db8055bcc.md "GetNumberOfFaceSets Method") | Gets number of face sets for which 'this' result was obtained. |
| GetType | Gets the Type of the current instance. (Inherited from Object.) |
| ToString | Returns a string that represents the current object. (Inherited from Object.) |

# Properties

| [AreObjectsAvailable](ea616568-4dc6-0ea7-8bf9-f0d91d4fca66.md "AreObjectsAvailable Property") | Shows whether 'issues' still contains the original data or whether these data have already been relinquished by 'getGeometricalObjects'. The former is true, the later is false. |
| [HasInvalidData](032f5f15-04f3-1257-14a2-2eb47d7bdf36.md "HasInvalidData Property") | Whether there were any inconsistencies in the face sets, stored in the tessellated shape builder while building geometrical objects. |
| [IsValidObject](8b8076fd-3775-a91b-40f2-fb7145028d66.md "IsValidObject Property") | Specifies whether the .NET object represents a valid Revit entity. |
| [Outcome](2da60445-35fa-81b1-e3df-e56f0ec408a1.md "Outcome Property") | What kinds of geometrical objects were built. |
