# ### Parameters
document
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..Document](db03274b-a107-aa32-9034-f3e0df4bb1ec.md "Document Class") The document. 
connector1
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..Connector](11e07082-b3f2-26a1-de79-16535f44716c.md "Connector Class") The end connector of the first placeholder. 
connector2
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..Connector](11e07082-b3f2-26a1-de79-16535f44716c.md "Connector Class") The end connector of second placeholder. 
connector3
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..Connector](11e07082-b3f2-26a1-de79-16535f44716c.md "Connector Class") The end connector of the third placeholder. 
# ### Return Value
True if connection succeeds, false otherwise. 
# Remarks
The three placeholders may or may not have physical connections. However, the first connector should be collinear with the second connector, and the third connector must have be able to be extended to have an intersection with first and second. 
If first placeholder and second placeholder have the same size, the second one is merged with first one and original placeholder element will become invalid. If connection fails, the placeholders cannot be physically connected.
