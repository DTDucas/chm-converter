Returns the vectors describing the curve at the specified parameter.

# Syntax

```text
public Transform ComputeDerivatives(
	double parameter,
	bool normalized
)
```

	parameter As Double, _
	normalized As Boolean _
) As Transform

	double parameter, 
	bool normalized
)
```
  
# ### Parameters
parameter
    Type: System..::..Double The parameter to be evaluated. 
normalized
    Type: System..::..Boolean If false, param is interpreted as natural parameterization of the curve. If true, param is expected to be in [0,1] interval mapped to the bounds of the curve. Setting to true is valid only if the curve is bound. 
# ### Return Value
The transformation containing the point on the curve, the tangent vector, derivative of tangent vector, and bi-normal vector. 
# Remarks
The following is the meaning of the transformation members: Origin is the point on the curve (equivalent to [Evaluate(Double, Boolean)](1145f18e-3e01-60df-e438-e176c38c3ce9.md "Evaluate Method")).BasisX is the tangent vector (the first derivative).BasisY is the second derivative. Note that for curves where this cannot be uniquely determined (e.g. lines), this will be a Zero vector.BasisZ is the bi-normal vector (tangent x normal). Note that for curves where normal cannot be uniquely determined (e.g. lines), this will be a Zero vector. None of the vectors are normalized.
