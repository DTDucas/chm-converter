ViewShapeBuilder..::..ValidateCurve Method (Curve)  
[ViewShapeBuilder Class](f99edd24-4519-56d5-a5d6-aa1565a893af.md "ViewShapeBuilder Class") See Also  
---  
Validates curve to be added to the view-specific shape being constructed. Called by AddCurve() to validate input. Expects a valid view normal to be set prior to the call. 
**Namespace:** [Autodesk.Revit.DB](87546ba7-461b-c646-cbb1-2cb8f5bff8b2.md "Autodesk.Revit.DB Namespace")**Assembly:** RevitAPI (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 24.0.0.0 (24.0.0.0)**Since:** 2015 
# Syntax
C#  
---  
```text
public bool ValidateCurve(
	Curve GCurve
)
```
  
Visual Basic  
---  
```text
Public Function ValidateCurve ( _
	GCurve As Curve _
) As Boolean
```
  
Visual C++  
---  
```text
public:
bool ValidateCurve(
	Curve^ GCurve
)
```
  
# ### Parameters
GCurve
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..Curve](400cc9b6-9ff7-de85-6fd8-c20002209d25.md "Curve Class") Curve object to be validated. 
# ### Return Value
True is %GCurve% is acceptable as a part of view-specific shape representation being built. 
# Remarks
This function may be used to pre-validate the geometry being added to avoid AddCurve() throwing an InvalidArgumentException Validation conditions depend on the type of view for which the shape representation is intended. For plan views, a curve is expected to be planar and non-degenerate (e.g., NOT a circle of zero radius).
