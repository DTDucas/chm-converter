IExportContext..::..OnLight Method   
[IExportContext Interface](7d0dc6df-db0e-6a07-3b42-8dde1bedb3c1.md "IExportContext Interface") Example See Also  
---  
This method marks the beginning of export of a light which is enabled for rendering. 
**Namespace:** [Autodesk.Revit.DB](87546ba7-461b-c646-cbb1-2cb8f5bff8b2.md "Autodesk.Revit.DB Namespace")**Assembly:** RevitAPI (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 24.0.0.0 (24.0.0.0)**Since:** 2014 
# Syntax
C#  
---  
```text
void OnLight(
	LightNode node
)
```
  
Visual Basic  
---  
```text
Sub OnLight ( _
	node As LightNode _
)
```
  
Visual C++  
---  
```text
void OnLight(
	LightNode^ node
)
```
  
# ### Parameters
node
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..LightNode](3904e399-f67a-a111-d963-5f91665b233c.md "LightNode Class") A node describing the light object. 
# Remarks
This method is only called for photo-rendering export (a custom exporter that implements [IPhotoRenderContext](d09d4ea2-1090-f2b9-8073-5fb8a796babf.md "IPhotoRenderContext Interface")). 
# Examples
CopyC#
```text
/// <summary>
/// This method is called for instances of lights
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// The Light API can be used to get more information about each particular light
/// </remarks>
public void OnLight(LightNode node)
{
   // Obtain local transform data of the light object.
   Transform lightTrf = node.GetTransform();

   // Note: 1. If your light coordinate system differs from the one in REvit, 
   //   The light's local transform should be adjusted to reflect the difference.

   // Note 2. This local transform describes the light source position and light direction data.
   //   It means the "TiltAngle" property of a spot light has already been accounted for.

   // If a stack of transformation is maintained by the context object,
   // the current combined transform will be multiplied by the local transform.
   Transform lightWorldTrf = m_TransformationStack.Peek().Multiply(lightTrf);

}
```
