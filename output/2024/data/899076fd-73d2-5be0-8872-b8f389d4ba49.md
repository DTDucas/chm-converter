# ### Parameters
line
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..Line](e7329450-434a-918b-661c-65e15e0585a5.md "Line Class")The line location of family instance. The line must in the plane of the view. 
symbol
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..FamilySymbol](a1acaed0-6a62-4c1d-94f5-4e27ce0923d3.md "FamilySymbol Class")A family symbol object that represents the type of the instance that is to be inserted.
specView
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..View](fb92a4e7-f3a7-ef14-e631-342179b18de9.md "View Class")A 2D view in which to display the family instance.
# Remarks
This overload applies only to 2D family line based detail symbols. The type/symbol that is used must be loaded into the document before this method is called. Families and their symbols can be loaded using the Document.LoadFamily or Document.LoadFamilySymbol methods. 
# Examples
CopyC#
```text
void CreateDetailComponent(Autodesk.Revit.DB.Document document, View view)
{
    // Create a detail component in the given view if it is a detail or drafting view
    if (view.ViewType == ViewType.Detail ||
        view.ViewType == ViewType.DraftingView)
    {
        FamilySymbol symbol = null;
        FilteredElementCollector fsCollector = new FilteredElementCollector(document);
        fsCollector.OfClass(typeof(FamilySymbol)).OfCategory(BuiltInCategory.OST_DetailComponents);
        ICollection<Element> collection = fsCollector.ToElements();
        foreach (Element element in collection)
        {
            FamilySymbol current = element as FamilySymbol;
            // This NewFamilyInstance overload requires a curve based family
            if (current.Family.FamilyPlacementType == FamilyPlacementType.CurveBasedDetail)
            {
                symbol = current;
                break;
            }
        }

        if (symbol != null)
        {
            // create a 2' detail component at the view's origin
            XYZ start = view.Origin;
            XYZ end = start + new XYZ(2, 0, 0);

            Line line = Line.CreateBound(start, end);

            FamilyInstance instance = document.Create.NewFamilyInstance(line, symbol, view);
        }
    }
}
