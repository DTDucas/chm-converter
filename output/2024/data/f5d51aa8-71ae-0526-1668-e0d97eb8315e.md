public:
PDFExportOptions^ GetOptions()
```
  
# ### Return Value
The options. 
# Remarks
Since the [!:PDFExportOptions.FileName] is not serialized, when [!:Combine] is trueTruetruetrue (True in Visual Basic) (which means all the views would be exported into one PDF file, whose file name is specified by [!:PDFExportOptions.FileName]), the returned [PDFExportOptions](e4236fc8-f8e7-fc74-1b81-9e3a4d9e966b.md "PDFExportOptions Class") would have [!:PDFExportOptions.FileName] as an empty string. The user has to set the [!:PDFExportOptions.FileName] before calling the [!:Document.Export(string, IList{ElementId}, PDFExportOption)] API exporting a "combined" PDF file.
