[AnalyticalMember Class](57c87ac5-a82e-5c7e-2f06-6dbf1f697566.md "AnalyticalMember Class") See Also

Sets Member Forces to Analytical Member. 
**Namespace:** [Autodesk.Revit.DB.Structure](d586b341-f687-9d90-e96d-255806b7d4fc.md "Autodesk.Revit.DB.Structure Namespace")**Assembly:** RevitAPI (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 24.0.0.0 (24.0.0.0)**Since:** 2023 
# Syntax
C#  
---  
```text
public void SetMemberForces(
	bool start,
	XYZ force,
	XYZ moment
)
```
  
Visual Basic  
---  
```text
Public Sub SetMemberForces ( _
	start As Boolean, _
	force As XYZ, _
	moment As XYZ _
)
```
  
Visual C++  
---  
```text
public:
void SetMemberForces(
	bool start, 
	XYZ^ force, 
	XYZ^ moment
)
```
  
# ### Parameters
start
    Type: System..::..Boolean Member Forces position on Analytical Member. True for start, false for end. 
force
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..XYZ](c2fd995c-95c0-58fb-f5de-f3246cbc5600.md "XYZ Class") The translational forces at specified position of the element. The x value of XYZ object represents force along x-axis of the Analytical Member coordinate system, y along y-axis, z along z-axis respectively. 
moment
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..XYZ](c2fd995c-95c0-58fb-f5de-f3246cbc5600.md "XYZ Class") The rotational forces at specified position of the element. The x value of XYZ object represents moment about x-axis of the Analytical Member coordinate system, y about y-axis, z about z-axis respectively. 
# Remarks
If Analytical Member already have member forces defined for that end, newly provided values replace current one. Member forces are strictly related with releases. This means that setting member forces values is reasonable only for directions that have releases set to false.
