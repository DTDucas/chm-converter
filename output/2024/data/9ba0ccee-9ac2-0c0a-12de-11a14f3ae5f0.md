The base elevation of the stairs run. 
**Namespace:** [Autodesk.Revit.DB.Architecture](720f0c58-cb2b-4f13-374a-7348ed0a1cd3.md "Autodesk.Revit.DB.Architecture Namespace")**Assembly:** RevitAPI (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 24.0.0.0 (24.0.0.0)**Since:** 2013 
# Syntax
C#  
---  
```text
public double BaseElevation { get; set; }
```
  
Visual Basic  
---  
```text
Public Property BaseElevation As Double
	Get
	Set
```
  
Visual C++  
---  
```text
public:
property double BaseElevation {
	double get ();
	void set (double value);
}
```
  
# Remarks
The base elevation has following restrictions: 
  * The base elevation is relative to the base elevation of the stairs to which the stairs run belongs.
  * When setting this property the value will be rounded automatically to a multiple of the riser height.
  * When setting this property for common run, the run's height will change according to the new base/top elevation. So the value must be less than the top elevation to keep run valid.
  * When setting this property for sketched run, whose height is fixed, the run's top elevation will be adjusted to keep the same run height.
