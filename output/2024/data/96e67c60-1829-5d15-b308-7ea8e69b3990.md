# Constructors
| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [BoundingBoxContainsPointFilter(XYZ)](b4c1d4ae-613f-979d-65d8-3c099cca6c3f.md "BoundingBoxContainsPointFilter Constructor \(XYZ\)") | Constructs a new instance of a filter to match elements with a bounding box that contains the given point. |
| [BoundingBoxContainsPointFilter(XYZ, Boolean)](349bf4ad-de49-f6fe-f223-6d782b70570f.md "BoundingBoxContainsPointFilter Constructor \(XYZ, Boolean\)") | Constructs a new instance of a filter to match elements with a bounding box that contains the given point, with the option to invert the filter and match all elements with a bounding box that do not contain the given point. |
| [BoundingBoxContainsPointFilter(XYZ, Double)](2d8feb9b-f5db-35b7-fef7-98c9ed0c5cce.md "BoundingBoxContainsPointFilter Constructor \(XYZ, Double\)") | Constructs a new instance of a filter to match elements with a bounding box that contains the given point, while specifying the tolerance to be used in deciding if the point matches the criteria. |
| [BoundingBoxContainsPointFilter(XYZ, Double, Boolean)](d2891b1c-b50c-cadc-addf-9256d44efd12.md "BoundingBoxContainsPointFilter Constructor \(XYZ, Double, Boolean\)") | Constructs a new instance of a filter to match elements with a bounding box that contains the given point, while specifying the tolerance to be used in deciding if the point matches the criteria. This constructor includes the option to invert the filter and match all elements with a bounding box that do not contain the given point. |

# Methods

| --- | --- |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Dispose](5d3ffdf8-dce9-0724-d101-44693775671c.md "Dispose Method") | (Inherited from [ElementFilter](b8b46cbf-9ecc-0745-ec53-c3c3b6510113.md "ElementFilter Class").) |
| Equals | Determines whether the specified Object is equal to the current Object. (Inherited from Object.) |
| GetHashCode | Serves as a hash function for a particular type.  (Inherited from Object.) |
| GetType | Gets the Type of the current instance. (Inherited from Object.) |
| [PassesFilter(Element)](1402f6e0-995c-2644-c7a9-7016a81a4ef4.md "PassesFilter Method \(Element\)") | Applies the filter to a given element.  (Inherited from [ElementFilter](b8b46cbf-9ecc-0745-ec53-c3c3b6510113.md "ElementFilter Class").) |
| [PassesFilter(Document, ElementId)](a8e86084-b91f-c3cf-c334-e163168328d6.md "PassesFilter Method \(Document, ElementId\)") | Applies the filter to a given element.  (Inherited from [ElementFilter](b8b46cbf-9ecc-0745-ec53-c3c3b6510113.md "ElementFilter Class").) |
| ToString | Returns a string that represents the current object. (Inherited from Object.) |

# Properties
| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Inverted](ceab2eea-cc4c-d7dc-b34c-b3c1f012eda1.md "Inverted Property") | True if the results of the filter are inverted; elements that would normally be accepted by this filter will be rejected, and elements that would normally be rejected will be accepted.  (Inherited from [ElementFilter](b8b46cbf-9ecc-0745-ec53-c3c3b6510113.md "ElementFilter Class").) |
| [IsValidObject](027ccc75-b7f6-4ee2-cf98-563df96b0dbb.md "IsValidObject Property") | Specifies whether the .NET object represents a valid Revit entity.  (Inherited from [ElementFilter](b8b46cbf-9ecc-0745-ec53-c3c3b6510113.md "ElementFilter Class").) |
| [Point](16b16bda-222b-5b5c-93d0-c6188f3fb1a2.md "Point Property") | The XYZ point to use when matching element bounding boxes. |
| [Tolerance](c5f8cb9d-75ea-8e8d-b985-5318a06921bf.md "Tolerance Property") | Allows control over the match criteria by using a tolerance in the geometry comparison. It is suggested to use this in cases where trivial differences should be considered when matching elements. |
