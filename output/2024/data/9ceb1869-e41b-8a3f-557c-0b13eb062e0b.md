# ### Parameters
room
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB.Architecture..::..Room](75c9d2c7-a402-ea8b-9e7c-f8bc3510bbd5.md "Room Class") The room which you want to locate in the circuit. Pass nullNothingnullptra null reference (Nothing in Visual Basic) to create a new room. 
circuit
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..PlanCircuit](9fdb77cb-c579-1cbd-71de-01f06a18ea3a.md "PlanCircuit Class") The circuit in which you want to locate a room. 
# ### Return Value
If successful the room is returned, otherwise nullNothingnullptra null reference (Nothing in Visual Basic). 
# Remarks
This method will regenerate the document even in manual regeneration mode.
