# Remarks
This is not a permanent state such as, for example [IsReadOnlyFile](c189f723-1465-0353-2ec1-57183905d73a.md "IsReadOnlyFile Property"). Value of this property changes dynamically multiple times within the life-time of an open document. Regardless of the mode a document is opened with, the model can only be modified inside an open transaction. Furthermore, even with a transaction open, the model is not always modifiable. Though this is rather a rare situation, it can happen, most likely during model regeneration, failure processing, or some events. An attempt to modify a non-modifiable document will result in throwing a ModificationOutsideTransactionException. See also [IsReadOnly](7e813a1b-9163-2509-f280-82572598432b.md "IsReadOnly Property")
