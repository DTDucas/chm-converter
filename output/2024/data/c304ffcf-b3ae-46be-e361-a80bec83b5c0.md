# Remarks
ServerPaths must refer to Revit models.
ServerPaths are relative to the central server location, and are of the form "RSN://{HostNodeName}/{model_path}".
The {model_path} portion is a relative path to a Revit model. For example, the following are valid server paths:
  * RSN://EXS/hospital.rvt
  * RSN://EXS.autodesk.com/Old Files/hotel2.rvt
  * RSN://EXS.autodesk.com/Old Files/Last Week/Tuesday\hotel2.rvt

The following would not be valid server paths: 
  * //EXS/Old Files/.rvt
  * EXS/hospital
