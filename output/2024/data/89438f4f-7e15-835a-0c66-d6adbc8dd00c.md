# Remarks
The Location property returns an object that can be used to find the location of an object within the project. An object may have a point location, such as a table or may have a line location. A wall is an example of an element that has a line location.

```text
void GetLocationInformation(Autodesk.Revit.DB.Element element)

    if (null == position)
    {
        prompt = "No location can be found in element.";
    }
    else

        // If the location is a point location, give the user information
