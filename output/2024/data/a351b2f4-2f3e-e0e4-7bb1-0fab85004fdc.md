# Syntax
C#

```text
public ReinforcementBarOrientation PrimaryBarOrientation { get; set; }
```
  
Visual Basic  
---  
```text
Public Property PrimaryBarOrientation As ReinforcementBarOrientation
	Get
	Set
```

```text
public:
property ReinforcementBarOrientation PrimaryBarOrientation {
	ReinforcementBarOrientation get ();
	void set (ReinforcementBarOrientation value);
}
```
  
# Remarks
The orientation corresponds to the bars' rotation in the Path Reinforcement element. It indicates the postion of the major segment of the primary Rebar Shape relative to the edges of a rectangular region which bounds the Path Reinforcement, where the top/exterior and bottom/interior come from the cover boundaries of the host, the near side edge is defined by the Path Reinforcement sketch line, and the far side edge is derived from bar length (defaulting to 5').
