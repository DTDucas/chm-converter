A surface of revolution defined by a profile curve and a local coordinate system. The surface is obtained by rotating the curve around Z axis of the local coordinate system.

# Remarks
The parametric equation of a surface of revolution is S(u, v) = center + C1(v)*cos(u)*xVec + C1(v)*sin(u)*yVec + C2(v)*zVec, where the profile curve in the SurfRev's xz plane has the parametric equation (C1(t), C2(t)). Note that the direction of X axis may agree or disagree with the chosen orientation of the surface.
