# Remarks
This event is raised when Revit is just about to export a view of the document. It is raised only during accelerated export jobs, in which views are exported in parallel using a background process. Accelerated export only occurs when exporting to DWF formats and not combining views into a single file.
Handlers of this event are permitted to make modifications to any document (including the active document), except for documents that are currently in read-only mode. 
Event is not cancellable. The 'Cancellable' property of event's argument is always False.
The following API functions are not available for the current document during this event: 
  * All overloads of Autodesk.Revit.DB.Document.Export()
  * Autodesk.Revit.DB.Document.Print()
  * [Print()()()()](1ea1e825-8044-7a27-d9b9-ca463443c3b9.md "Print Method") and similar overloads.
  * [SubmitPrint()()()()](0c9524b7-33b5-8c76-2843-c7024f03e4d7.md "SubmitPrint Method") and similar overloads.
  * [Close()()()()](da2f27b9-7255-4950-82a2-86e1432ff9f0.md "Close Method") and similar overloads.
  * [Save()()()()](8dec13b6-71f4-45d2-74e3-b109153721b5.md "Save Method") .
  * [SaveAs(String)](25c44d4a-b220-5898-b28c-a2cf6a8a8673.md "SaveAs Method \(String\)") and similar overloads.

Exception [InvalidOperationException](9e715f03-3884-e539-4dd6-8d7545733adc.md "InvalidOperationException Class") will be thrown if any of the above methods is called during this event.
Another event [ViewExported](0a3d3bee-957a-45e0-3779-b1b924a0ce0f.md "ViewExported Event") will be raised immediately after view exporting is finished.
