| --- | --- | --- |
| [BoundEnabled](b6b443e6-b188-795d-7bd9-730e61f820c2.md "BoundEnabled Property") | Indexed access for loops. |
| [Bounds](8ae9bebf-834d-cb1b-fcff-8b1084996ac1.md "Bounds Property") | Indexed access for loops. Use 0 for Min and 1 for Max. |
| [Enabled](07f7ad25-2d1b-74a1-65e8-d91d3f81ea29.md "Enabled Property") | Defines whether the entire bounding box is enabled. |
| [IsReadOnly](d516bcd2-a3fd-a578-58f6-f1add979bd07.md "IsReadOnly Property") | Identifies if the object is read-only or modifiable. (Inherited from [APIObject](beb86ef5-39ad-3f0d-0cd9-0c929387a2bb.md "APIObject Class").) |
| [IsSet](4c7c9482-953b-8685-679f-4d333ac15a7e.md "IsSet Property") | Indicates whether the bounding box is set. |
| [Max](b79bd9ee-ccff-cc81-8a32-9eb9bdb1e58c.md "Max Property") | Maximum coordinates (upper-right-front corner of the box). |
| [MaxEnabled](07f07ae6-88ed-cd88-c7c0-8542865ca96c.md "MaxEnabled Property") | Defines whether the maximum bound is active for given dimension. |
| [Min](608e6914-2465-b572-2c5d-2a6cd696c740.md "Min Property") | Minimum coordinates (lower-left-rear corner of the box). |
| [MinEnabled](a4883a49-f6db-1a7f-74b3-ef3fc985879e.md "MinEnabled Property") | Defines whether the minimum bound is active for given dimension. |
