This method is called after unhandled curve was tessellated to polyline segments and sent to the output. 
Note for 2D export: if the export is performed for the view in non-Wireframe display style, then 
  * this method is called outside of view, instance and link begin/end calls but still between OnElementBegin2D/OnElementEnd2D calls
  * this method is never called for annotation elements, i.e. their geometry should be processed in methods OnCurve and OnPolyline
