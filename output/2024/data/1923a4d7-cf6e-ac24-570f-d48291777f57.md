# ### Return Value
The extensible enum value representing the Id of the service. 
# Remarks
For all built-in external services, their Ids are all items of the enumerated type ExternalServices.BuiltInExternalServices.
Third-party services will have their respective Ids based on GUIDs. It is important to note that a service Id must be unique. It will be an error if two external services try to register with the same Id.
