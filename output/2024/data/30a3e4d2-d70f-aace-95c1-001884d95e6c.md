The real number that represents the scale of the conformal transformation. 
**Namespace:** [Autodesk.Revit.DB](87546ba7-461b-c646-cbb1-2cb8f5bff8b2.md "Autodesk.Revit.DB Namespace")**Assembly:** RevitAPI (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 24.0.0.0 (24.0.0.0)**Since:** 2021 
# Syntax

# Remarks
When the transformation is conformal and can be decomposed as the product of a rigid-body motion, uniform scale and reflection, this property returns the scale value of the uniform scale transformation.
