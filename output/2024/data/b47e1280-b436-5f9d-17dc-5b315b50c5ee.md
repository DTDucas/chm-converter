# Remarks
The concept of zones is central to the way in which engineers design HVAC systems. When you are designing HVAC systems, you relate to zones as spaces that are under the same thermostatic control. Conceptually, zones are an arbitrary set of areas or volumes within a building that is controlled by one thermostat. An area based load is a collection of one or more electrical load areas. When it has the AreaBasedLoadData, it is an area based load, otherwise, it is a zone.
