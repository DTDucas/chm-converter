This method is called when a Polyline is being output.

# ### Parameters
node
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..PolylineNode](d0d38779-f0a4-e975-e71d-c8e7026cadfd.md "PolylineNode Class") An output node that represents a Polyline. 
# ### Return Value
Return RenderNodeAction.Proceed if you wish to receive tessellated geometry (polyline segments) for this polyline, or otherwise return RenderNodeAction.Skip. 
Note for 2D export: if the export is performed for the view in non-Wireframe display style tesselated geometry will be output regardless of the return value.
# Remarks
Note that this method is invoked only if the custom exporter was set up to include geometric objects in the output stream. See [IncludeGeometricObjects](2ce1075e-380e-01e7-6459-b7467c2a2414.md "IncludeGeometricObjects Property") for mode details. 
Note for 2D export: if the export is performed for the view in non-Wireframe display style this method will be called regardless of whether the object will be eventially output, i.e. even if it's occluded by another element.
