IExportContext..::..OnInstanceBegin Method   
[IExportContext Interface](7d0dc6df-db0e-6a07-3b42-8dde1bedb3c1.md "IExportContext Interface") Example See Also  
---  
This method marks the start of processing of an instance node (e.g. a family instance). 
**Namespace:** [Autodesk.Revit.DB](87546ba7-461b-c646-cbb1-2cb8f5bff8b2.md "Autodesk.Revit.DB Namespace")**Assembly:** RevitAPI (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 24.0.0.0 (24.0.0.0)**Since:** 2014 
# Syntax
C#  
---  
```text
RenderNodeAction OnInstanceBegin(
	InstanceNode node
)
```
  
Visual Basic  
---  
```text
Function OnInstanceBegin ( _
	node As InstanceNode _
) As RenderNodeAction
```
  
Visual C++  
---  
```text
RenderNodeAction OnInstanceBegin(
	InstanceNode^ node
)
```
  
# ### Parameters
node
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..InstanceNode](4f7fbd19-9a61-c173-2b4f-9c0be9e550bb.md "InstanceNode Class")
# ### Return Value
Return RenderNodeAction.Skip if you wish to skip processing this family instance, or return RenderNodeAction.Proceed otherwise. 
# Examples
CopyC#
```text
/// <summary>
/// This method marks the start of processing of an Instance node (e.g. a family instance).
/// </summary>
public RenderNodeAction OnInstanceBegin(InstanceNode node)
{
   // We can get particular information about the family instance and its type if we need to
   ElementId symbolId = node.GetSymbolGeometryId().SymbolId;
   FamilySymbol famSymbol = m_document.GetElement(symbolId) as FamilySymbol;

   // Typically, an export context has to manage a stack of transformation
   // for all nested objects, such as instances, lights, links, etc.
   // A combined transformation needs to be applied to the incoming geometry
   // (providing all geometry is to be flattened in the resultant format.)
   m_TransformationStack.Push(m_TransformationStack.Peek().Multiply(node.GetTransform()));

   // We can either skip this instance or proceed with rendering it.
   return RenderNodeAction.Proceed;
}

/// <summary>
/// This method marks the end of processing of an Instance Node (e.g. a family instance).
/// </summary>
public void OnInstanceEnd(InstanceNode node)
{
   // Note: This method is invoked even for instances that were skipped.

   // If we maintain a transformation stack, we need to remove the latest one from it.
   m_TransformationStack.Pop();
}
```
