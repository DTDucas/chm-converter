# Syntax
C#

```text
public gbXMLExportBuildingEnvelope BuildingEnvelopeDeterminationMethod { get; set; }
```
  
Visual Basic

```text
Public Property BuildingEnvelopeDeterminationMethod As gbXMLExportBuildingEnvelope
	Get
	Set
```

```text
public:
property gbXMLExportBuildingEnvelope BuildingEnvelopeDeterminationMethod {
	gbXMLExportBuildingEnvelope get ();
	void set (gbXMLExportBuildingEnvelope value);
}
```
  
# Remarks
The analysis is performed for the detailed GreenBuildingXML export and in heating and cooling load calculations. This method uses a combination of ray-casting and flood-fill algorithms in order to find the building elements that are exposed to the outside of the building. Analytical surface originated from the building elements in the envelope will be classified as exterior or shading surfaces.
