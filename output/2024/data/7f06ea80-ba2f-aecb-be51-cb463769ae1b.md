# ### Return Value
True if this CompoundStructure represents a series of parallel layers that stretch from bottom to top, false otherwise. 
# Remarks
Differs from IsVerticallyCompound as a vertically compound structure might happen not to have any horizontal breaks. For that situation, both IsVerticallyCompound and this method will return true.
