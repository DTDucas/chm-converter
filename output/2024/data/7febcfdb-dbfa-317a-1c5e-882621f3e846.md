[ItemFactoryBase Class](cba2c84a-22c0-e6e7-a99c-67656901853a.md "ItemFactoryBase Class") Example See Also

Inserts a new instance of a family into the document, using a location, type/symbol, the host element and a reference direction.

```text

	XYZ^ location,

# ### Parameters
location
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..XYZ](c2fd995c-95c0-58fb-f5de-f3246cbc5600.md "XYZ Class")The physical location where the instance is to be placed.
symbol
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..FamilySymbol](a1acaed0-6a62-4c1d-94f5-4e27ce0923d3.md "FamilySymbol Class")A FamilySymbol object that represents the type of the instance that is to be inserted.
referenceDirection
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..XYZ](c2fd995c-95c0-58fb-f5de-f3246cbc5600.md "XYZ Class") A vector that dictates the direction of certain family instances. 
host
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..Element](eb16114f-69ea-f4de-0d0d-f7388b105a16.md "Element Class") A host object into which the instance will be embedded 
structuralType
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB.Structure..::..StructuralType](0a0a3793-5fce-283d-4953-a137f5593db9.md "StructuralType Enumeration") If structural then specify the type of the component. 
# ### Return Value
If creation was successful then an instance to the new object is returned, otherwise nullNothingnullptra null reference (Nothing in Visual Basic).
# Remarks
This method allows you to create FamilyInstance objects that require both a location and direction. If the instance fails to be created an exception may be thrown. 
The type/symbol that is used must be loaded into the document before this method is called. Families and their symbols can be loaded using the Document.LoadFamily or Document.LoadFamilySymbol methods. 
Some Families, such as Beams, have more than one endpoint and are inserted in the same manner as single point instances. Once inserted these linear family instances can have their endpoints changed by using the instance's Element.Location property.
Note: if the created family instance includes nested instances, the API framework will automatically regenerate the document during this method call.
