[FailuresAccessor Class](dea68b06-a061-fc05-d814-db741f2e7f14.md "FailuresAccessor Class") See Also  
---  
Resolves one or more failures using last set failure resolution type for each of the failures. If failure resolution type was not set for some of failures, default failure resolution type will be used. 
**Namespace:** [Autodesk.Revit.DB](87546ba7-461b-c646-cbb1-2cb8f5bff8b2.md "Autodesk.Revit.DB Namespace")**Assembly:** RevitAPI (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 24.0.0.0 (24.0.0.0)**Since:** 2011 
# Syntax

public void ResolveFailures(
	IList<FailureMessageAccessor> failures
)

	failures As IList(Of FailureMessageAccessor) _

	IList<FailureMessageAccessor^>^ failures
)
```
  
# ### Parameters
failures
    Type: System.Collections.Generic..::..IList<(Of <(<'[FailureMessageAccessor](753477d8-b720-97a0-26f5-439d49de418c.md "FailureMessageAccessor Class")>)>)> The accessors to the failures to be resolved. 
# Remarks
After execution of the failure resolutions the failures will not be removed from the document automatically. To prevent failure from being delivered to the user, failures (pre)processor should return ProceedWithCommit. It will cause failures to be regenerated and failure resolution process to be restarted. If attempt to resolve failure was not successful, and the same failure is present on repetitive calls of the failures (pre)processor, the preprocessor code should take care to attempt a different resolution the next time the failure appears, to avoid an infinite loop.
