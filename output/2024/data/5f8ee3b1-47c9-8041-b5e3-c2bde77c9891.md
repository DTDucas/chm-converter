# Methods
| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Dispose](c9ee1344-bc19-d833-52e7-dcc4931fe085.md "Dispose Method") | (Inherited from [Surface](bb391358-5ca0-578d-e8e2-6d1b30c472d8.md "Surface Class").) |
| Equals | Determines whether the specified Object is equal to the current Object. (Inherited from Object.) |
| [GetBasisSurface](5fb55047-9bf3-aa08-a0f6-695916946c30.md "GetBasisSurface Method") | Returns a copy of basis surface of this OffsetSurface. |
| [GetBoundingBoxUV](5084214f-219f-780f-fe03-f16b62b2660d.md "GetBoundingBoxUV Method") | Gets the UV bounding box of the surface.  (Inherited from [Surface](bb391358-5ca0-578d-e8e2-6d1b30c472d8.md "Surface Class").) |
| GetHashCode | Serves as a hash function for a particular type.  (Inherited from Object.) |
| [GetOffsetDistance](580da623-2d47-9eea-e549-497b32a82d03.md "GetOffsetDistance Method") | Returns offset distance of this OffsetSurface. |
| GetType | Gets the Type of the current instance. (Inherited from Object.) |
| [IsOrientationSameAsBasisSurface](de30829a-52b3-7afc-ff09-0d891621d289.md "IsOrientationSameAsBasisSurface Method") | Indicates whether the orientation of the OffsetSurface is same as that of its basis surface, in the sense that their oriented normals at any (u, v) have the same direction. |
| [Project](802cc09b-d0a4-dfc5-8ca1-e8c5e8cd4ced.md "Project Method") | Project a 3D point orthogonally onto a surface (to find the nearest point). Throws InvalidOperationException if the projection fails.  (Inherited from [Surface](bb391358-5ca0-578d-e8e2-6d1b30c472d8.md "Surface Class").) |
| [ProjectWithGuessPoint](db8cc42a-9f34-611a-d9c5-852f3935887f.md "ProjectWithGuessPoint Method") | Project a 3D point orthogonally onto a surface (to find the nearest point). This method is meant to be used when a good approximate solution for the projection is available. Throws InvalidOperationException if the projection fails.  (Inherited from [Surface](bb391358-5ca0-578d-e8e2-6d1b30c472d8.md "Surface Class").) |
| ToString | Returns a string that represents the current object. (Inherited from Object.) |
