# ### Parameters
DBView
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..View](fb92a4e7-f3a7-ef14-e631-342179b18de9.md "View Class") The floor plan view to use when computing the shortest distance. 
pathStart
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..XYZ](c2fd995c-95c0-58fb-f5de-f3246cbc5600.md "XYZ Class") The start point of the path. The input Z coordinates are ignored and set to the view's level elevation. 
pathEnd
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..XYZ](c2fd995c-95c0-58fb-f5de-f3246cbc5600.md "XYZ Class") The end point of the path. The input Z coordinates are ignored and set to the view's level elevation. 
# ### Return Value
The newly created path of travel element, or nullNothingnullptra null reference (Nothing in Visual Basic) if no path between the two points is found. 
# Remarks
InvalidOperationException is thrown if PathOfTravel cannot be created for the following conditions: 
  * View has crop box active and crop box is split 
  * View has crop box active and start or end point lies outside of the crop 
  * View model outline area is larger than the current limit (2,000,000 sq.ft.) 
  * View export contains too much geometry (more than 200,000 lines) 
  * Start and end points are too close
