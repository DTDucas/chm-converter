RuledSurface..::..Create Method (Curve, Curve)  
[RuledSurface Class](9a33fec9-bbcd-f035-3194-cf36122b6cc6.md "RuledSurface Class") See Also  
---  
Creates a Surface object coincident with the ruled surface joining two bounded generating curves. 
**Namespace:** [Autodesk.Revit.DB](87546ba7-461b-c646-cbb1-2cb8f5bff8b2.md "Autodesk.Revit.DB Namespace")**Assembly:** RevitAPI (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 24.0.0.0 (24.0.0.0)**Since:** 2017

# ### Parameters
profileCurve1
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..Curve](400cc9b6-9ff7-de85-6fd8-c20002209d25.md "Curve Class") The first profile curve; must be bounded and non-degenerate. 
profileCurve2
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..Curve](400cc9b6-9ff7-de85-6fd8-c20002209d25.md "Curve Class") The second profile curve; must be bounded and non-degenerate. 
# ### Return Value
The created surface. Note that this surface may not be of type RuledSurf. 
# Remarks
The returned surface may not be of type RuledSurf - this function will create a surface of the simplest possible type (Plane, CylindricalSurface, etc.) that can be used to represent the given ruled surface. Given that the surface may be simplified, this function does not guarantee any particular parameterization of the surface. The curves should be such that a ruled surface whose rulings connect points on the two curves with the same normalized coordinates has no self-intersections or interior singularities.
