# Remarks
The points to be interpolated are represented as ReferencePoints, which must already exist in the document. In terms of appearance and graphics control, CurveByPoints behaves similarly to ModelCurve. The main difference being that a ModelCurve refers to a SketchPlane, while a CurveByPoints does not. For more methods capable of accessing data from CurveByPoints elements, see the static class CurveByPointsUtils.
