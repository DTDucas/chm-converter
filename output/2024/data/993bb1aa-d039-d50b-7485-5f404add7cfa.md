ItemFactoryBase..::..NewFamilyInstance Method (Face, Line, FamilySymbol)  
[ItemFactoryBase Class](cba2c84a-22c0-e6e7-a99c-67656901853a.md "ItemFactoryBase Class") Example See Also  
---  
Inserts a new instance of a family onto a face of an existing element, using a line on that face for its position, and a type/symbol.
**Namespace:** [Autodesk.Revit.Creation](ded320da-058a-4edd-0418-0582389559a7.md "Autodesk.Revit.Creation Namespace")**Assembly:** RevitAPI (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 24.0.0.0 (24.0.0.0)

# ### Parameters
face
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..Face](e32b3b1f-66fc-57cb-6e1c-aa81d1bf3e63.md "Face Class")A face of a geometry object.
position
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..Line](e7329450-434a-918b-661c-65e15e0585a5.md "Line Class")A line on the face defining where the symbol is to be placed.
symbol
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..FamilySymbol](a1acaed0-6a62-4c1d-94f5-4e27ce0923d3.md "FamilySymbol Class")A FamilySymbol object that represents the type of the instance that is to be inserted. Note that this symbol must represent a family whose [FamilyPlacementType](7fcd2fda-21c3-9b9b-8ef3-ae2e53e02a05.md "FamilyPlacementType Property") is WorkPlaneBased or CurveBased.
# ### Return Value
An instance of the new object if creation was successful, otherwise nullNothingnullptra null reference (Nothing in Visual Basic).
# Remarks
Use this method to insert one family instance on a face of another element, using a line on the face to define the position and direction of the new symbol. 
The type/symbol that is used must be loaded into the document before this method is called. Families and their symbols can be loaded using the Document.LoadFamily or Document.LoadFamilySymbol methods.
The host object must support insertion of instances, otherwise this method will fail. If the instance fails to be created an exception may be thrown.
Note: if the created family instance includes nested instances, the API framework will automatically regenerate the document during this method call.
