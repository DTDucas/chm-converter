# ### Return Value
True if it is possible to create parts from this DirectShape. 
# Remarks
While it is generally possible to create parts from DirectShape elements, some characteristics make parts creation impossible. This property is re-evaluated every time the element's geometry is modified (via a call to SetShape or AppendShape). Invalid configurations include: DirectShape elements containing a polymesh, or an open geometry, as well as DirectShape elements not containing any solids and DirectShape elements configured as NotReferenceable (via a call to SetOptions). Finally, if a DirectShape element has DirectShapeType instances in its geometry, and one of those DirectShapeTypes has a configuration that is incompatible with parts creation, the DirectShape element will also be incompatible with parts creation.
