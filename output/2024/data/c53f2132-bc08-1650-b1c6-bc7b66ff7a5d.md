Returns a face that represents the portion of the room face bounded by the boundary element. 
**Namespace:** [Autodesk.Revit.DB](87546ba7-461b-c646-cbb1-2cb8f5bff8b2.md "Autodesk.Revit.DB Namespace")**Assembly:** RevitAPI (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 24.0.0.0 (24.0.0.0)**Since:** 2012 
# Syntax
C#

```text
public Face GetSubface()
```

```text
Public Function GetSubface As Face

```text
public:
Face^ GetSubface()
```
  
# ### Return Value
The sub-face. 
# Remarks
If the spatial element's face is adjacent to multiple bounding elements (such as two different walls), there will be one sub-face for each portion of the spatial element's face where it is adjacent to one of those room-bounding elements. This is equivalent to the return of GetRoomFace() if the entire room face is created by the boundary element.
