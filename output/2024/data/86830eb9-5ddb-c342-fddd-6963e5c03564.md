# ### Return Value
An object containing the ElementId of the link and an enum value indicating any errors which occurred while trying to load. LinkLoadResultType.LinkLoaded indicates success. 
# Remarks
If the link is currently loaded, Revit must unload the link before reloading it. Any changes made in-memory to the link's shared coordinates will be discarded.
This function regenerates the document. 
The document's Undo history will be cleared by this command. As a result, this command and others executed before it cannot be undone. All transaction phases (e.g. transactions transaction groups and sub-transaction) that were explicitly started must be finished prior to calling this method.
This function is identical to RevitLinkType.Load() and is included for convenience.
