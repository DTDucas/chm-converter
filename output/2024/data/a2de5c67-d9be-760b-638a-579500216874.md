# Remarks
A line pattern is a pattern of dashes and dots used to control the way the lines of an object are drawn in Revit. Line patterns are used in the definition of GraphicsStyle objects. A line pattern is defined by a repeating sequence segments. Each segment is a dash, a dot or a space. A line pattern definition must contain an even number of segments, starting with a visible segment (a dash or a dot) and alternating between visible segments and spaces.
