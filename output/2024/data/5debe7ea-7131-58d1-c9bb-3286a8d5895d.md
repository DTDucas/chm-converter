# ### Parameters
transGroupName
    Type: System..::..String Name of the group. The name will be used only for a group that is [assimilated](158471e4-5554-16ed-f9bf-f7499b86309c.md "Assimilate Method") at the end. 
# ### Return Value
If started successfully, this method returns TransactionStatus.Started. 
# Remarks
A transaction group can be started only when there is no transaction started currently. It can be started inside another transaction group though. With such group nesting it is required that inner transaction groups are finished (i.e. rolled back, committed, or assimilated) before outer groups are.
