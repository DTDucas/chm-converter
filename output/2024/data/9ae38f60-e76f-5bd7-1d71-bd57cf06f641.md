NumberingSchema..::..MoveSequence Method   
[NumberingSchema Class](8f2b22da-5963-301f-44d8-10c68828c436.md "NumberingSchema Class") Example See Also  
---  
Moves all elements of a numbering sequence from one partition to another. 
**Namespace:** [Autodesk.Revit.DB](87546ba7-461b-c646-cbb1-2cb8f5bff8b2.md "Autodesk.Revit.DB Namespace")**Assembly:** RevitAPI (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 24.0.0.0 (24.0.0.0)**Since:** 2015 
# Syntax
C#  
---  
```text
public void MoveSequence(
	string fromPartition,
	string newPartition
)
```
  
Visual Basic  
---  
```text
Public Sub MoveSequence ( _
	fromPartition As String, _
	newPartition As String _
)
```
  
Visual C++  
---  
```text
public:
void MoveSequence(
	String^ fromPartition, 
	String^ newPartition
)
```
  
# ### Parameters
fromPartition
    Type: System..::..String Name of the partition that determines which numbering sequence to move. The sequence must exist already, otherwise an exception will be thrown. 
newPartition
    Type: System..::..String Name of a partition into which the source sequence is going to be moved. The schema must not have a sequence for this partition yet (i.e. the schema does not have an element that was assigned to such a partition.) 
Leading and trailing white space is ignored in the given string and will be removed automatically.
# Remarks
All numbers assigned to elements in the sequence remain the same.
This operation modifies the Partition parameter of all elements in the given sequence. Therefore, all the elements must be accessible for editing.
Elements can be moved only to a partition that does not exist yet. To move elements to an existing partition use the [AppendSequence](0a89ca78-ca34-93fa-4fa7-71883a535497.md "AppendSequence Method") method.

    using (Transaction transaction = new Transaction(document))
    {

        // Step 1
        // First we move all elements from one sequence into 
        // a partition we know does not exist. This action will
        // create the temporary partition and remove the original
        // one (part1).
        schema.MoveSequence(part1, tempPartition);

        // Step 2
        // With the sequence in partition 'part1' removed
        // we can now move elements from the second sequence to it.
        // This action will re-create a sequence in partition 'part1'
        // and remove the sequence in partition 'part2'
        schema.MoveSequence(part2, part1);

        // Step 3
        // Finally, we can move elements 'parked' in the temporary
        // sequence to partition 'part2', for that partition was
        // removed in the previous step and thus can now be created
        // again. The temporary partition will be automatically 
        // removed upon completing this step.
        schema.MoveSequence(tempPartition, part2);

        transaction.Commit();
    }

| --- | --- |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions..::..ArgumentException](2e6e4206-97a8-dd4b-df5d-4269f4bb6088.md "ArgumentException Class") | The sequence fromPartition does not exist in the schema. -or- The sequence newPartition does already exist in the schema. -or- the given newPartition cannot be used as a valid name of a numbering partition because it contains characters that are considered invalid, such as non-printable characters or those that cannot be used in a file's name. |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions..::..ArgumentNullException](631e1424-60f4-929b-4e52-dda9dcd26316.md "ArgumentNullException Class") | A non-optional argument was null |

It may be an indication that the element is not free to be edited at present. |
