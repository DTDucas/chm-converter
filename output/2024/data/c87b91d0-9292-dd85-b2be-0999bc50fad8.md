---  
The maximum distance between mesh triangles and model geometry. This is a percentage value. By exporting, the real value of surface tolerance is calculated as a percent from the length of the diameter of the body bounding box. The minimum allowed value is 0.001%. The maximum allowed value is 1.0%. Default value is 0.1%.

# Remarks
This property can be set by using export resolution type (by creation of STLExportOptions or using [!:Autodesk::Revit::DB::STLExportOptions::setTessellationSettings(ExportResolution::Enum)] method). In the case of Fine (0.005%), Medium (0.016%) and Coarse (0.04%) resolutions, this property is considered as explicitly set by the user. In the case of Custom resolution type, this property is only allowed to be obtained if it has been explicitly set.
