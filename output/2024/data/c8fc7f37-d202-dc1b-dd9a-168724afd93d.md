| --- | --- |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [BendAngle](b1007d78-3a5f-6ee1-9a7c-67142e707ba2.md "BendAngle Property") | The range of permissible angles at this bend. |
| [IsValidObject](beb5d1c9-c52d-3be9-189a-7557551f0424.md "IsValidObject Property") | Specifies whether the .NET object represents a valid Revit entity. |
| [Turn](77147703-c606-28f2-5ebc-01e0f2ddd25d.md "Turn Property") | The sense of the turn. The Turn property must be set to Left or Right on each internal vertex before the RebarShapeDefinitionBySegments is used. Default is permissible for the first and last vertex, since they do not correspond to bends. |
