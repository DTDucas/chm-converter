# ### Parameters
movedPoints
    Type: System.Collections.Generic..::..IList<(Of <(<'[XYZ](c2fd995c-95c0-58fb-f5de-f3246cbc5600.md "XYZ Class")>)>)> The points to be moved. 
moveVector
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..XYZ](c2fd995c-95c0-58fb-f5de-f3246cbc5600.md "XYZ Class") The vector which describes the distance and direction for the move. Note that the Z value represents a change in elevation, pass Z=0 to move the point without changing the elevation. 
# Remarks
The points which don't exist in the current TopographySurface will be ignored. This function ignores input points that do not exist, unless all of the input points do not exist, which will result in an exception. This applies to a TopographySurface element (not a SiteSubRegion or a topography surface associated with a BuildingPad), which shoule be in an active TopographyEditScope. 
# Exceptions
| Exception | Condition |
| --- | --- |
| --- | --- |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions..::..ArgumentException](2e6e4206-97a8-dd4b-df5d-4269f4bb6088.md "ArgumentException Class") | There are no points in the input points set. |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions..::..ArgumentNullException](631e1424-60f4-929b-4e52-dda9dcd26316.md "ArgumentNullException Class") | A non-optional argument was null |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions..::..InvalidOperationException](9e715f03-3884-e539-4dd6-8d7545733adc.md "InvalidOperationException Class") | This element is not a TopographySurface. -or- The points of this topography surface are not editable. -or- The TopographySurface element is not in an active TopographyEditScope. Modification cannot be made on this TopographySurface. -or- None of the input points exists in the current TopographySurface. |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions..::..ModificationForbiddenException](53205486-5917-7c33-8e67-e362106ddc97.md "ModificationForbiddenException Class") | The document containing this TopographySurface is in failure mode: an operation has failed, and Revit requires the user to either cancel the operation or fix the problem (usually by deleting certain elements). -or- The document containing this TopographySurface is being loaded, or is in the midst of another sensitive process. |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions..::..ModificationOutsideTransactionException](8f025460-c283-ea99-aa8a-5a36e11528f4.md "ModificationOutsideTransactionException Class") | The document containing this TopographySurface has no open transaction. |
