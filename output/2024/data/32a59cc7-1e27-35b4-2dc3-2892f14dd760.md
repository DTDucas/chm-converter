# ### Parameters
view
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..View](fb92a4e7-f3a7-ef14-e631-342179b18de9.md "View Class") The view to insert onto a sheet. 
allowReplaceExistingSheetViewport
    Type: System..::..Boolean A indicator which allows the user to replace the existing viewport. 
If true, the viewport representing this view will be replaced by the new viewport created during placement. If the view is allowed only to be on one sheet, this will remove the viewport from the old sheet. If the view is allowed to be on multiple sheets, and the view is currently placed on the active sheet, the old viewport on this sheet will be replaced. 
If false, if the view is only allowed to be on one sheet, or if the view is allowed to be on multiple sheets but is already on the active sheet, an exception will be thrown. 
# Remarks
This method opens its own transaction, so it's not permitted to be invoked in an active transaction. In a single invocation, the user can place only one view onto the active sheet. 
The user is not permitted to change the active sheet view or the view to be placed during this placement operation (the operation will be cancelled). 
The user can cancel the placement operation by pressing Cancel or ESC or a click elsewhere in the UI. 
This method can't be used to place a schedule on a sheet. Use [ScheduleSheetInstance](68db8e46-90de-6b54-3dae-598957d94201.md "ScheduleSheetInstance Class") Create() to add schedules to sheets.
