[CompoundStructure Class](dc1a081e-8dab-565f-145d-a429098d353c.md "CompoundStructure Class") See Also  
---  
Takes a horizontal slice through a sample wall to which this CompoundStructure is applied and returns a simple compound structure which describes that slice, i.e. a series of parallel layers.

# Syntax
C#  
---  
```text
public CompoundStructure GetSimpleCompoundStructure(
	double wallHeight,
	double distAboveBase
)
```
  
Visual Basic  
---  
```text
Public Function GetSimpleCompoundStructure ( _
	wallHeight As Double, _
	distAboveBase As Double _
) As CompoundStructure
```
  
Visual C++  
---  
```text
public:
CompoundStructure^ GetSimpleCompoundStructure(
	double wallHeight, 
	double distAboveBase
)
```
  
# ### Parameters
wallHeight
    Type: System..::..Double The height of the wall. 
distAboveBase
    Type: System..::..Double The distance from the base of the wall at which to take the section. If distAboveBase < 0, then internally distAboveBase = 0 is used. If distAboveBase > wallHeight, then internally distAboveBase = wallHeight is used. 
# ### Return Value
A simple CompoundStructure representing a series of parallel layers. 
# Remarks
If [IsVerticallyCompound](cd352f22-8ca4-b3b6-f247-d9865a91bb6f.md "IsVerticallyCompound Property") is false, the output is a copy of this CompoundStructure.
