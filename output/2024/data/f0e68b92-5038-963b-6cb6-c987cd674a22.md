# Properties
| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Coefficient](486c56ee-3ee4-17d9-8b5d-fee28f09dfdc.md "Coefficient Property") | The calculated coefficient of this segment, dimensionless. |
| [Flow](a476f7d6-0e62-1c81-4375-8abf65c5f90b.md "Flow Property") | The calculated flow of this segment, in ft^3/s. The positive value means the flow is from the start to the end node, the negative value means opposite direction. |
| [FlowState](ce2a3a55-ea44-ceb8-63e9-1a848f4362d4.md "FlowState Property") | The calculated flow state of this segment. |
| [FrictionFactor](b50a8aef-e217-e788-8d82-00251c30d4dd.md "FrictionFactor Property") | The calculated friction factor of this segment, dimensionless. |
| [IsCriticalPath](36768112-4250-51dd-16b6-ecbc4db55f4e.md "IsCriticalPath Property") | Verifies if the segment is on the critical path. |
| [IsValidObject](f1485ad6-94df-54fa-bea4-aff6b4db1252.md "IsValidObject Property") | Specifies whether the .NET object represents a valid Revit entity. |
| [PressureDrop](d24084b4-7305-029a-1931-d8c6f3905951.md "PressureDrop Property") | The calculated pressure drop of this segment, in kg/(ft*s^2). |
| [RelativeRoughness](67de6fa1-ffa7-f961-10f6-f4ad50d13b23.md "RelativeRoughness Property") | The relative roughness of this segment, dimensionless. |
| [ReynoldsNumber](868514c5-aa7f-34c4-ba3d-96c6ec9c6ee2.md "ReynoldsNumber Property") | The Reynolds number of this segment, dimensionless. |
| [SectionNumber](979e0788-341c-758a-6533-fdebb3953fb6.md "SectionNumber Property") | The section this segment belongs to. |
| [Velocity](388a6784-7351-d0a7-3603-a6b85bf47548.md "Velocity Property") | The calculated velocity of this segment, in ft/s. |
| [VelocityPressure](14ce6033-ad83-e724-d440-d72eb6823ec9.md "VelocityPressure Property") | The calculated velocity pressure of this segment, in kg/(ft*s^2). |
