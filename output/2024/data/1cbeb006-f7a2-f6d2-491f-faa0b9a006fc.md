# Members
| Member name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| --- | --- |
| None | Priority = 0 This is deprecated and should not be used. |
| Structure | Priority = 1 (highest priority) |
| Substrate | Priority = 2 |
| Insulation | Priority = 3 |
| Finish1 | Priority = 4 |
| Finish2 | Priority = 5 |
| Membrane | A membrane layer must have thickness 0. It is not represented graphically. |
| StructuralDeck | Indicates layer is a structural deck. |

# Remarks
The function is used primarily to determine layer priority which affects how layers of distinct elements interact at a join. Typically, layers penetrate lower priority layers and merge with layers of the same priority.
