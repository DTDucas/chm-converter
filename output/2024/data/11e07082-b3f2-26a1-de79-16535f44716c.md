# Remarks
This connector is an item that is a part of another element (duct, pipe, fitting, or equipment etc.). This connector does not represent the connector element that can be created inside a family; for that element, refer to [ConnectorElement](cd7d7579-1058-e8ca-d55a-c3a914843667.md "ConnectorElement Class").
