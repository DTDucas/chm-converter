# ### Parameters
options
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..FailureHandlingOptions](c03bb2e5-f679-bf24-4e87-08b3c3a08385.md "FailureHandlingOptions Class") An instance of FailureHandlingOptions to be applied to the transaction 
# Remarks
Options can be set at any time before the transaction is either committed or rolled back. See [FailureHandlingOptions](c03bb2e5-f679-bf24-4e87-08b3c3a08385.md "FailureHandlingOptions Class") for details about available options. Once committed or rolled back, the transaction object will reset its options to their default values. 
# Examples
CopyC#
```text
// All and any transaction should be enclosed in a 'using'
// block or guarded within a try-catch-finally blocks
// to guarantee that a transaction does not out-live its scope.
using (Transaction transaction = new Transaction(doc))
{
   // Before we modify a document, we must start a transaction
   transaction.Start("Creating room");

   // obtain the current options and add failures preprocessor to it.
   // Note: preprocessor implements IFailuresProcessor and will receive 
   // a notification about failures eventually posted during the transaction.
   FailureHandlingOptions options = transaction.GetFailureHandlingOptions();
   options.SetFailuresPreprocessor(new RoomWarningSwallower());
   transaction.SetFailureHandlingOptions(options);

   // Modify the document and commit the transaction.
   if (null != doc.Create.NewRoom(level, UV.Zero))
   {
      // Now, before the the transaction is committed, if there happened to 
      // be any failure, the preprocessor would receive them first and would
      // have the option to analyze them, and ignore or re-qualify them.
      transaction.Commit();
   }
   else  // could not create the room; no need to commit the transaction
   {
      transaction.RollBack();
   }
}
```
