# Methods
| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [AdjustForCyclicalBounds](9cbf97b3-28f6-3479-044f-a7ec0419192b.md "AdjustForCyclicalBounds Method") | Shifts the input coordinates in the cyclical dimensions so that they fall in the [lower bounds, upper bounds] range. |
| [AreCoordinatesInBounds](66edda4f-79f3-30d7-f485-3e8a1ec33da4.md "AreCoordinatesInBounds Method") | Determines whether given coordinates are within the bounds. |
| [Dispose](7b592b4d-75ef-6992-a9e7-4ffe5667f237.md "Dispose Method") | Releases all resources used by the [RepeaterBounds](99c1ffdf-818b-1918-a6ba-42b7904ca4bc.md "RepeaterBounds Class") |
| Equals | Determines whether the specified Object is equal to the current Object. (Inherited from Object.) |
| GetHashCode | Serves as a hash function for a particular type.  (Inherited from Object.) |
| [GetLowerBound](a7d2526a-92fe-3d1d-9574-0e9bd21c9808.md "GetLowerBound Method") | Returns the smallest index of the array in the given dimension. |
| GetType | Gets the Type of the current instance. (Inherited from Object.) |
| [GetUpperBound](ed36936e-ea19-b021-04f1-32921cd17313.md "GetUpperBound Method") | Returns the highest index of the array in the given dimension. |
| [IsCyclical](d5d3a8b0-62bc-6783-3d96-b11564f6ebb6.md "IsCyclical Method") | True if the array doesn't have finite bounds in the given dimension. Cyclical bounds indicate that the array forms a closed loop in the given dimension. |
| ToString | Returns a string that represents the current object. (Inherited from Object.) |

# Properties
| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [DimensionCount](b8017ee1-1af3-bfb3-a6cc-da8e228674a4.md "DimensionCount Property") | The number of dimensions of the bounds (0, 1 or 2 for zero, one or two dimensional arrays.) |
| [IsValidObject](f8937f4f-7010-a79c-f08f-4f76ff90b33c.md "IsValidObject Property") | Specifies whether the .NET object represents a valid Revit entity. |
