# ### Parameters
document
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..Document](db03274b-a107-aa32-9034-f3e0df4bb1ec.md "Document Class") The document to which the new callout will be added. 
parentViewId
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..ElementId](44f3f7b1-3229-3404-93c9-dc5e70337dd6.md "ElementId Class") The view in which the callout appears. Callouts can be created in FloorPlan, CeilingPlan, StructuralPlan, Section, Elevation, and Detail views. 
viewFamilyTypeId
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..ElementId](44f3f7b1-3229-3404-93c9-dc5e70337dd6.md "ElementId Class") The id of the ViewFamilyType which will be used by the new callout ViewSection. Detail ViewFamilyTypes can be used in all parent views except for CeilingPlan and Drafting views. FloorPlan, CeilingPlan, StructuralPlan, Section, and Elevation ViewFamilyTypes may be be used in parent views that also use a type with the same ViewFamily enum value. For example, in StructuralPlan parent views both StructuralPlan and Detail ViewFamilyTypes are allowed. 
point1
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..XYZ](c2fd995c-95c0-58fb-f5de-f3246cbc5600.md "XYZ Class") Determines the extents of the callout symbol in the parent view. 
point2
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..XYZ](c2fd995c-95c0-58fb-f5de-f3246cbc5600.md "XYZ Class") Determine the extents of the callout symbol in the parent view. 
# ### Return Value
The new callout view. The view will be either a ViewSection, ViewPlan or ViewDetail. 
# Remarks
The extents of new callout are determined by using the two argument points as the opposing corners of a rectangle which is aligned to the directions of the parent view. The callout's near and far cut planes will match those of the parent view. The new view will receive a unique name.
