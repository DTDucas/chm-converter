# ### Parameters
document
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..Document](db03274b-a107-aa32-9034-f3e0df4bb1ec.md "Document Class") The family document in which to create the filled region. 
typeId
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..ElementId](44f3f7b1-3229-3404-93c9-dc5e70337dd6.md "ElementId Class") The filled region type Id. 
sketchPlane
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..SketchPlane](ba104029-d175-7e75-caef-667a4281f4af.md "SketchPlane Class") The sketch plane for use with the filled region. 
boundaries
    Type: System.Collections.Generic..::..IList<(Of <(<'[CurveLoop](84824924-cb89-9e20-de6e-3461f429dfd6.md "CurveLoop Class")>)>)> The filled region boundaries, which will be projected onto the sketch plane. 
# ### Return Value
The new filled region. 
# Remarks
If the sketch plane is currently in use, then a copy of the sketch plane will be created and used. The sketch plane normal must be parallel to the model's X, Y or Z axis. The sketch plane can be a planar face reference to model geometry. The line style of the boundaries will be set to thin lines by default. 
# Exceptions
| Exception | Condition |
| --- | --- |
| --- | --- |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions..::..ArgumentException](2e6e4206-97a8-dd4b-df5d-4269f4bb6088.md "ArgumentException Class") | The document is not a 3d model family. -or- The Id typeId is invalid. -or- Filled regions can't be created in this document or view. -or- The sketch plane is not suitable for model elements. -or- The sketch plane normal is not parallel to the model's X, Y or Z axis. -or- The input curve loops cannot compose a valid boundary, that means: the "curveLoops" collection is empty; or some curve loops intersect with each other; or each curve loop is not closed individually; or each curve loop is not planar; or each curve loop is not in a plane parallel to the sketch plane; or input curves contain at least one helical curve. |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions..::..ArgumentNullException](631e1424-60f4-929b-4e52-dda9dcd26316.md "ArgumentNullException Class") | A non-optional argument was null |
