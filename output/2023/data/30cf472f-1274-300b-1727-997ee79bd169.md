| Equals | Determines whether the specified Object is equal to the current Object. (Inherited from Object.) |
| [GetConstraints](cc9ad8f1-a696-0421-e641-f575ef564287.md "GetConstraints Method") | Retrieve the list of constraints associated with this vertex. |
| GetHashCode | Serves as a hash function for a particular type.  (Inherited from Object.) |
| GetType | Gets the Type of the current instance. (Inherited from Object.) |
| [SetConstraints](f2dc51f3-19af-6a95-6e93-d8717c6a5d05.md "SetConstraints Method") | Assign a new list of constraints to this vertex. |

| [BendAngle](b1007d78-3a5f-6ee1-9a7c-67142e707ba2.md "BendAngle Property") | The range of permissible angles at this bend. |
| [IsValidObject](beb5d1c9-c52d-3be9-189a-7557551f0424.md "IsValidObject Property") | Specifies whether the .NET object represents a valid Revit entity. |

The Turn property must be set to Left or Right on each internal vertex before the RebarShapeDefinitionBySegments is used. Default is permissible for the first and last vertex, since they do not correspond to bends. |
