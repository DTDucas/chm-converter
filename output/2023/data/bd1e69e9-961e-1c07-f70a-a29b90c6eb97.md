Transaction..::..RollBack Method   
[Transaction Class](308ebf8d-d96d-4643-cd1d-34fffcea53fd.md "Transaction Class") Example See Also  
---  
Rolls back all changes made to the model during the transaction. 
**Namespace:** [Autodesk.Revit.DB](87546ba7-461b-c646-cbb1-2cb8f5bff8b2.md "Autodesk.Revit.DB Namespace")**Assembly:** RevitAPI (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 23.0.0.0 (23.1.0.0)
# Syntax

public TransactionStatus RollBack()

TransactionStatus RollBack()
```
  
# ### Return Value
If finished successfully, this method returns TransactionStatus.RolledBack. 
Be aware that the returned status does not have to be necessarily the same like the status returned by [GetStatus()()()()](fdf98941-eee4-d8af-e3f7-5b6c7ccc3c74.md "GetStatus Method") even when the method is called immediately after rolling back the transaction. Such difference may happen due to actions made by a transaction finalizer, if there was one set. (See [FailureHandlingOptions](c03bb2e5-f679-bf24-4e87-08b3c3a08385.md "FailureHandlingOptions Class") for more details.)
# Remarks
By rolling back a transaction, all changes made to the model are discarded. RollBack may only be called for a transaction that has been started. (Use the [GetStatus()()()()](fdf98941-eee4-d8af-e3f7-5b6c7ccc3c74.md "GetStatus Method") method to check the current state.) Be aware that rolling back may be delayed (as a result of failure handling.) Callers should always check the returned status to test whether a transaction was rolled back successfully. Only after rolling back is fully completed, the transaction may be started again. 
# Examples
CopyC#
```text
public bool CreateGrid(Autodesk.Revit.DB.Document document, XYZ p1, XYZ p2)
{
   // All and any transaction should be enclosed in a 'using'
   // block or guarded within a try-catch-finally blocks
   // to guarantee that a transaction does not out-live its scope.
   using (Transaction transaction = new Transaction(document, "Creating Grid"))
   {
      // Must start a transaction to be able to modify a document
      if (TransactionStatus.Started == transaction.Start())
      {
         // We create a line and use it as an argument to create a grid
         Line gridLine = Line.CreateBound(p1, p2);

         if ((null != gridLine) && (null != Grid.Create(document, gridLine)))
         {
             if (TransactionStatus.Committed == transaction.Commit())
             {
                return true;
             }
         }

         // For we were unable to create the grid, we will roll the transaction back
         // (although on this simplified case we know there weren't any other changes)

         transaction.RollBack();
      }
   }
   return false;
}
