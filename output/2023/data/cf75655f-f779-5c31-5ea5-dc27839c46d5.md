```text
Public Property LeaderEndPosition As XYZ
	Get
	Set
```
  
Visual C++

```text
public:
property XYZ^ LeaderEndPosition {
	XYZ^ get ();
	void set (XYZ^ value);
}
```
  
# Remarks
This property is not applicable to all dimensions. For example, it is not available for spot slope dimensions, multi-segments dimensions, dimensions using equality formula, and when dimension style is ordinate.
If the position is not applicable, this property throws InvalidOperationException.
Notes for SpotDimension: 
  * This property throws InvalidOperationException if dimension has no leader.
  * Setting of this property works differently for leader with and without shoulder.
  * If leader has shoulder, setting is limited by points on line between leader end and shoulder points (projected point is used).
  * Setting of this property also affects TextPosition.
