ItemFactoryBase..::..NewFamilyInstance Method (Face, XYZ, XYZ, FamilySymbol)  
[ItemFactoryBase Class](cba2c84a-22c0-e6e7-a99c-67656901853a.md "ItemFactoryBase Class") Example See Also  
---  
Inserts a new instance of a family onto a face of an existing element, using a location, reference direction, and a type/symbol.

# ### Parameters
face
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..Face](e32b3b1f-66fc-57cb-6e1c-aa81d1bf3e63.md "Face Class")A face of a geometry object.
location
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..XYZ](c2fd995c-95c0-58fb-f5de-f3246cbc5600.md "XYZ Class")Point on the face where the instance is to be placed.
referenceDirection
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..XYZ](c2fd995c-95c0-58fb-f5de-f3246cbc5600.md "XYZ Class")A vector that defines the direction of the family instance. Note that this direction defines the rotation of the instance on the face, and thus cannot be parallel to the face normal.
symbol
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..FamilySymbol](a1acaed0-6a62-4c1d-94f5-4e27ce0923d3.md "FamilySymbol Class")A FamilySymbol object that represents the type of the instance that is to be inserted. Note that this symbol must represent a family whose [FamilyPlacementType](7fcd2fda-21c3-9b9b-8ef3-ae2e53e02a05.md "FamilyPlacementType Property") is WorkPlaneBased.
# ### Return Value
An instance of the new object if creation was successful, otherwise nullNothingnullptra null reference (Nothing in Visual Basic).
# Remarks
Use this method to insert one family instance on a face of another element, using a point on the face and a vector to define the position and direction of the new symbol. 
The type/symbol that is used must be loaded into the document before this method is called. Families and their symbols can be loaded using the Document.LoadFamily or Document.LoadFamilySymbol methods.
The host object must support insertion of instances, otherwise this method will fail. If the instances fails to be created an exception may be thrown.
Some Families, such as Beams, have more than one endpoint and are inserted in the same manner as single point instances. Once inserted, these linear family instances can have their endpoints changed by using the instance's Element.Location property.
Note: if the created family instance includes nested instances, the API framework will automatically regenerate the document during this method call.
