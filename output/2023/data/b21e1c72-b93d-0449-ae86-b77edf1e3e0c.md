[IPointCloudEngine Interface](c444fe12-e214-eac3-e934-bd3aa84b70ca.md "IPointCloudEngine Interface") See Also  
---  
Implement this method to construct the IPointCloudAccess interface for the point cloud designated by the identifier. This method is called once during the creation of a PointCloudType. 
**Namespace:** [Autodesk.Revit.DB.PointClouds](5974062a-47d4-c7bb-16f2-d5dd193bd170.md "Autodesk.Revit.DB.PointClouds Namespace")**Assembly:** RevitAPI (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 23.0.0.0 (23.1.0.0)**Since:** 2012 
# Syntax
C#  
---  
```text
IPointCloudAccess CreatePointCloudAccess(
	string identifier
)
```
  
Visual Basic  
---  
```text
Function CreatePointCloudAccess ( _
	identifier As String _
) As IPointCloudAccess
```
  
Visual C++  
---  
```text
IPointCloudAccess^ CreatePointCloudAccess(
	String^ identifier
)
```
  
# ### Parameters
identifier
    Type: System..::..String An identifier unique to the point cloud. This will be a file name if the engine was registered as file-based, or an arbitrary identifier if the engine is not file-based. 
# ### Return Value
The object that can be used to create iterators and interrogate the point cloud for its features. 
# Remarks
The instance of the returned IPointCloudAccess is then used by Revit to display instances of the point cloud in Revit graphics and in the user interface.
