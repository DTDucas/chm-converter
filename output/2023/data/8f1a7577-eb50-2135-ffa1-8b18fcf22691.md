# Remarks
This event is only supported for Collaboration for Revit and will not be raised for those operations occurring in local-worksharing and Revit Server workflow. Users may not change the document in the handler for this event. It is NOT recommended to do any time-consuming work when handling WorksharedOperationProgressChanged event. This can increase workshared operation time." Exception [ModificationForbiddenException](53205486-5917-7c33-8e67-e362106ddc97.md "ModificationForbiddenException Class") will be thrown if any document-modifying method is called during this event's handler.
