Rebar..::..RebarShapeMatchesCurvesHooksAndEndTreatment Method   
[Rebar Class](70fd7426-f4a4-591c-8c06-3c18dda45e7d.md "Rebar Class") See Also  
---  
Checks if rebarShape matches curves, hooks and end treatment. If the RebarShapeDefinesHooks flag in ReinforcementSettings has been set to false, then this method will ignore the hook information. If the RebarShapeDefinesEndTreatment flag in ReinforcementSettings has been set to false, then this method will ignore the end treatment information.

# ### Parameters
rebarShape
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB.Structure..::..RebarShape](0a370e32-eaba-785e-7e1f-9330929525fc.md "RebarShape Class") A RebarShape element that defines the shape of the rebar. 
barType
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB.Structure..::..RebarBarType](467b44cc-54e7-3ecf-07e1-ad15d05fe800.md "RebarBarType Class") A RebarBarType element that defines bar diameter, bend radius and material of the rebar. 
norm
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..XYZ](c2fd995c-95c0-58fb-f5de-f3246cbc5600.md "XYZ Class") The normal to the plane that the rebar curves lie on. 
curves
    Type: System.Collections.Generic..::..IList<(Of <(<'[Curve](400cc9b6-9ff7-de85-6fd8-c20002209d25.md "Curve Class")>)>)> An array of curves that define the shape of the rebar curves. They must belong to the plane defined by the normal and origin. Bends and hooks should not be included in the array of curves. 
startHook
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB.Structure..::..RebarHookType](3c7a78d5-f92b-e58b-e7c9-7927537498fd.md "RebarHookType Class") A RebarHookType element that defines the hook for the start of the bar. 
endHook
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB.Structure..::..RebarHookType](3c7a78d5-f92b-e58b-e7c9-7927537498fd.md "RebarHookType Class") A RebarHookType element that defines the hook for the end of the bar. 
startHookOrient
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB.Structure..::..RebarHookOrientation](e8365754-0811-8d4e-864a-55bf34af3a87.md "RebarHookOrientation Enumeration") Defines the orientation of the hook plane at the start of the rebar with respect to the orientation of the first curve and the plane normal. Only two values are permitted: Value = Right: The hook is on your right as you stand at the end of the bar, with the bar behind you, taking the bar's normal as "up." Value = Left: The hook is on your left as you stand at the end of the bar, with the bar behind you, taking the bar's normal as "up." 
endHookOrient
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB.Structure..::..RebarHookOrientation](e8365754-0811-8d4e-864a-55bf34af3a87.md "RebarHookOrientation Enumeration") Defines the orientation of the hook plane at the end of the rebar with respect to the orientation of the last curve and the plane normal. Only two values are permitted: Value = Right: The hook is on your right as you stand at the end of the bar, with the bar behind you, taking the bar's normal as "up." Value = Left: The hook is on your left as you stand at the end of the bar, with the bar behind you, taking the bar's normal as "up." 
hookRotationAngleAtStart
    Type: System..::..Double The out of plane hook rotation angle at the start of the bar. 
hookRotationAngleAtEnd
    Type: System..::..Double The out of plane hook rotation angle at the end of the bar. 
endTreatmentTypeIdAtStart
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..ElementId](44f3f7b1-3229-3404-93c9-dc5e70337dd6.md "ElementId Class") The end treatment type id at the start of the bar. 
endTreatmentTypeIdAtEnd
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..ElementId](44f3f7b1-3229-3404-93c9-dc5e70337dd6.md "ElementId Class") The end treatment type id at the end of the bar. 
# ### Return Value
True if rebarShape matches curves and hooks.
