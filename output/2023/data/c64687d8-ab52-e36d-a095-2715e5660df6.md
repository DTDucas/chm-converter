# Syntax
C#  
---  
```text
public bool Move(
	XYZ translation
)
```
  
Visual Basic  
---  
```text
Public Function Move ( _
	translation As XYZ _
) As Boolean
```
  
Visual C++  
---  
```text
public:
bool Move(
	XYZ^ translation
)
```
  
# ### Parameters
translation
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..XYZ](c2fd995c-95c0-58fb-f5de-f3246cbc5600.md "XYZ Class")The vector by which the element is to be moved.
# ### Return Value

# Examples
CopyC#
```text
bool MoveUsingLocationCurve(Autodesk.Revit.ApplicationServices.Application application, Wall wall)
{
    LocationCurve wallLine = wall.Location as LocationCurve;
    XYZ translationVec = new XYZ(10, 20, 0);
    return (wallLine.Move(translationVec));
}
```

CopyVB.NET
```text
Private Function MoveUsingLocationCurve(application As Autodesk.Revit.ApplicationServices.Application, wall As Wall) As Boolean
    Dim wallLine As LocationCurve = TryCast(wall.Location, LocationCurve)
    Dim translationVec As New XYZ(10, 20, 0)
    Return (wallLine.Move(translationVec))
End Function
```
