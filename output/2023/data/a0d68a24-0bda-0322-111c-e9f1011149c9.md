NurbSpline..::..CreateCurve Method (Int32, IList<(Of <(<'Double>)>)>, IList<(Of <(<'XYZ>)>)>, IList<(Of <(<'Double>)>)>)  
[NurbSpline Class](65c43ffe-3972-ae2b-4aa4-e2901cdbb3a8.md "NurbSpline Class") See Also  
---  
Creates a new geometric Curve object from NURBS curve data, which includes weights. The created curve may be a NURBSpline or a simpler curve such as line or arc. 
**Namespace:** [Autodesk.Revit.DB](87546ba7-461b-c646-cbb1-2cb8f5bff8b2.md "Autodesk.Revit.DB Namespace")**Assembly:** RevitAPI (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 23.0.0.0 (23.1.0.0)**Since:** 2017 
# Syntax
C#  
---  
```text
public static Curve CreateCurve(
	int degree,
	IList<double> knots,
	IList<XYZ> controlPoints,
	IList<double> weights
)
```
  
Visual Basic  
---  
```text
Public Shared Function CreateCurve ( _
	degree As Integer, _
	knots As IList(Of Double), _
	controlPoints As IList(Of XYZ), _
	weights As IList(Of Double) _
) As Curve
```
  
Visual C++

```text
public:
static Curve^ CreateCurve(
	int degree, 
	IList<double>^ knots, 
	IList<XYZ^>^ controlPoints, 
	IList<double>^ weights
)
```
  
# ### Parameters
degree
    Type: System..::..Int32 The degree of the NURBSpline. 
knots
    Type: System.Collections.Generic..::..IList<(Of <(<'Double>)>)> The knots of the NURBSpline. 
controlPoints
    Type: System.Collections.Generic..::..IList<(Of <(<'[XYZ](c2fd995c-95c0-58fb-f5de-f3246cbc5600.md "XYZ Class")>)>)> The control points of the NURBSpline. 
weights
    Type: System.Collections.Generic..::..IList<(Of <(<'Double>)>)> The weights of the NURBSpline. 
# ### Return Value
The new Curve object. 
# Remarks
Degree must be 1 or greater. The number of control points must be greater than degree. The number of knots must equal the sum of degree, number of controlPoints and 1. The distinct knot values (ignoring multiplicities) must be in increasing order. The first degree+1 knots should be identical, as should the last degree+1 knots. The multiplicities of other (interior) knots should be less than degree -1. The number of weights must be equal to the the number of control points. The values of all weights must be positive.
