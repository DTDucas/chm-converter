# Syntax
C#

```text
public int MergeRegionsAdjacentToSegment(
	int segmentId,
	int layerIdxForMergedRegion
)
```
  
Visual Basic  
---  
```text
Public Function MergeRegionsAdjacentToSegment ( _
	segmentId As Integer, _
	layerIdxForMergedRegion As Integer _
) As Integer
```

```text
public:
int MergeRegionsAdjacentToSegment(
	int segmentId, 
	int layerIdxForMergedRegion
)
```
  
# ### Parameters
segmentId
    Type: System..::..Int32 The id of a segment in the underlying grid. 
layerIdxForMergedRegion
    Type: System..::..Int32 The index of the layer to which the resulting region will be associated. 
# ### Return Value
The id of the resulting region. If -1 is returned, then the operation would have produced an invalid region and was not performed. 
# Exceptions
