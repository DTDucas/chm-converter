| [FarDistance](16edd64f-ac8d-23aa-dfc7-514e4bebcd13.md "FarDistance Property") | Distance from eye point to far plane of view frustum along the view direction. |
| [HorizontalExtent](8247b292-f93f-684f-8270-a7c2fa92a6c8.md "HorizontalExtent Property") | Distance between left and right planes on the target plane. |
| [IsPerspective](37b664d0-d6fe-63b8-97f3-d23f3ec7c237.md "IsPerspective Property") | Identifies whether the projection is orthographic or perspective |
| [IsPespective](e5b44850-c499-942a-b1b1-1cbf145e1417.md "IsPespective Property") | Identifies whether the projection is orthographic or perspective |
| [IsValidObject](5bb6d514-66ec-24a5-8560-7bdd92a6b766.md "IsValidObject Property") | Specifies whether the .NET object represents a valid Revit entity. |
| [NearDistance](74236919-5164-1ddb-b5bd-5b41a4d18dc5.md "NearDistance Property") | Distance from eye point to near plane of view frustum along the view direction. |
| [RightOffset](5d30cbc2-2b80-5b26-3379-00d83a582d3a.md "RightOffset Property") | Distance that the target plane is offset towards the right where right is normal to both Up direction and View direction. This offset shifts both left and right planes. |
