**Namespace:** [Autodesk.Revit.DB](87546ba7-461b-c646-cbb1-2cb8f5bff8b2.md "Autodesk.Revit.DB Namespace")**Assembly:** RevitAPI (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 23.0.0.0 (23.1.0.0)**Since:** 2015 
# Syntax
C#

```text
public IList<ElementId> ChangeNumber(
	string partition,
	int fromNumber,
	int toNumber
)
```
  
Visual Basic

```text
Public Function ChangeNumber ( _
	partition As String, _
	fromNumber As Integer, _
	toNumber As Integer _
) As IList(Of ElementId)
```

```text
public:
IList<ElementId^>^ ChangeNumber(
	String^ partition, 
	int fromNumber, 
	int toNumber
)
```
  
# ### Parameters
partition
    Type: System..::..String Name of the partition that identifies the sequence containing the number to be changed. 
fromNumber
    Type: System..::..Int32 Number to be changed; there must already be an element with that number in the sequence. 
toNumber
    Type: System..::..Int32 Number to change to; no element must have this number yet in the sequence. 
# ### Return Value
A collection of elements affected by the change of the number 
# Remarks
This method gives the caller the ability to overwrite any number used in a given numbering sequence as long as the new number does not exist in the same sequence yet. If an attempt is made to replace a number by another that already exists, an exception will be thrown.
The new number will automatically be applied to all elements that bear the original number, thus those elements must be free to be modified. A collection of element Ids of all the affected elements is returned by this method.
The method is independent of the sequence's current starting number that might have been assigned previously, meaning that the new number will be accepted even if it is lower than the previously set start number in the sequence.
