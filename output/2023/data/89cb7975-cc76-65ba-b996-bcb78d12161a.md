BooleanOperationsUtils..::..ExecuteBooleanOperation Method   
[BooleanOperationsUtils Class](a7be98f3-9e8a-ee51-f46c-2479cb72c598.md "BooleanOperationsUtils Class") Example See Also  
---  
Perform a boolean geometric operation between two solids, and return a new solid to represent the result. 
**Namespace:** [Autodesk.Revit.DB](87546ba7-461b-c646-cbb1-2cb8f5bff8b2.md "Autodesk.Revit.DB Namespace")**Assembly:** RevitAPI (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 23.0.0.0 (23.1.0.0)**Since:** 2012 
# Syntax
C#  
---  
```text
public static Solid ExecuteBooleanOperation(
	Solid solid0,
	Solid solid1,
	BooleanOperationsType booleanType
)
```
  
Visual Basic  
---  
```text
Public Shared Function ExecuteBooleanOperation ( _
	solid0 As Solid, _
	solid1 As Solid, _
	booleanType As BooleanOperationsType _
) As Solid
```
  
Visual C++

```text
public:
static Solid^ ExecuteBooleanOperation(
	Solid^ solid0, 
	Solid^ solid1, 
	BooleanOperationsType booleanType
)
```
  
# ### Parameters
solid0
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..Solid](7a3b5ac1-c66d-9f81-a11d-9bcd4e026295.md "Solid Class") The first solid object. A copy will be taken of the input object, so any solid whether obtained from a Revit element or not would be accepted. 
solid1
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..Solid](7a3b5ac1-c66d-9f81-a11d-9bcd4e026295.md "Solid Class") The second solid object. A copy will be taken of the input object, so any solid whether obtained from a Revit element or not would be accepted. 
booleanType
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..BooleanOperationsType](46aeb9cd-4b44-0dcf-6f78-469c1271f5d4.md "BooleanOperationsType Enumeration") boolean operation type. 
# ### Return Value
The result geometry. 
# Examples
CopyC#
```text
private void ComputeIntersectionVolume(Solid solidA, Solid solidB)
{
    Solid intersection = BooleanOperationsUtils.ExecuteBooleanOperation(solidA, solidB, BooleanOperationsType.Intersect);
    double volumeOfIntersection = intersection.Volume;
}
```

CopyVB.NET
```text
Private Sub ComputeIntersectionVolume(solidA As Solid, solidB As Solid)
    Dim intersection As Solid = BooleanOperationsUtils.ExecuteBooleanOperation(solidA, solidB, BooleanOperationsType.Intersect)
    Dim volumeOfIntersection As Double = intersection.Volume
End Sub
```

# Exceptions
| Exception | Condition |
| --- | --- |
| --- | --- |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions..::..ArgumentNullException](631e1424-60f4-929b-4e52-dda9dcd26316.md "ArgumentNullException Class") | A non-optional argument was null |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions..::..ArgumentOutOfRangeException](60f148c9-ece0-a6bb-4e12-bb4a9c8c8a24.md "ArgumentOutOfRangeException Class") | A value passed for an enumeration argument is not a member of that enumeration |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions..::..InvalidOperationException](9e715f03-3884-e539-4dd6-8d7545733adc.md "InvalidOperationException Class") | Failed to perform the Boolean operation for the two solids. This may be due to geometric inaccuracies in the solids, such as slightly misaligned faces or edges. If so, eliminating the inaccuracies by making sure the solids are accurately aligned may solve the problem. This also may be due to one or both solids having complexities such as more than two faces geometrically meeting along a single edge, or two coincident edges, etc. Eliminating such conditions, or performing a sequence of Boolean operations in an order that avoids such conditions, may solve the problem. |
