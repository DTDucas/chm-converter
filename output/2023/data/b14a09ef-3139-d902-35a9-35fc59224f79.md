A flag identifying whether text-wrapping is currently active in this text element or not. 
If text wrapping is active the width of the text box remains constant and the text will wrap. The height of the text box will automatically adjust to accomodate the height of the text. 
If text wrapping is not active the text does not wrap and the width of the text box adjusts with the width of the longest line of text. As the text width changes, the position of the text may change depending on the [HorizontalAlignment](13fde654-9ee9-8852-bbc0-708e19bc0fb5.md "HorizontalAlignment Property")

# Remarks
This is currently a read-only property and its value is set when the text element is created. If the element was created with a specified width or if an explicit width was set later, the wrapping would be automatically set as active. It means that any text line that is longer that the current width of the text-box will automatically wrapped onto the next line.
