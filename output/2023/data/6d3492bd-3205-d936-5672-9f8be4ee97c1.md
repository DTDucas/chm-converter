The [CylindricalSurface](95d452c1-6f7f-9d8e-a4fb-e2f1fe2818bc.md "CylindricalSurface Class") type exposes the following members.
# Methods
| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Create](ae360b1d-65c3-2991-62c7-13193f5792e5.md "Create Method") | Construct a cylindrical surface defined by a local coordinate system and a radius. |
| [Dispose](c9ee1344-bc19-d833-52e7-dcc4931fe085.md "Dispose Method") | (Inherited from [Surface](bb391358-5ca0-578d-e8e2-6d1b30c472d8.md "Surface Class").) |
| Equals | Determines whether the specified Object is equal to the current Object. (Inherited from Object.) |
| [GetBoundingBoxUV](5084214f-219f-780f-fe03-f16b62b2660d.md "GetBoundingBoxUV Method") | Gets the UV bounding box of the surface.  (Inherited from [Surface](bb391358-5ca0-578d-e8e2-6d1b30c472d8.md "Surface Class").) |
| [GetFrameOfReference](547f05b7-1e57-bc40-8df8-681fb80e61e9.md "GetFrameOfReference Method") | Returns frame of reference associated with this CylindricalSurface. |
| GetHashCode | Serves as a hash function for a particular type.  (Inherited from Object.) |
| GetType | Gets the Type of the current instance. (Inherited from Object.) |
| [Project](802cc09b-d0a4-dfc5-8ca1-e8c5e8cd4ced.md "Project Method") | Project a 3D point orthogonally onto a surface (to find the nearest point). Throws InvalidOperationException if the projection fails.  (Inherited from [Surface](bb391358-5ca0-578d-e8e2-6d1b30c472d8.md "Surface Class").) |
| [ProjectWithGuessPoint](db8cc42a-9f34-611a-d9c5-852f3935887f.md "ProjectWithGuessPoint Method") | Project a 3D point orthogonally onto a surface (to find the nearest point). This method is meant to be used when a good approximate solution for the projection is available. Throws InvalidOperationException if the projection fails.  (Inherited from [Surface](bb391358-5ca0-578d-e8e2-6d1b30c472d8.md "Surface Class").) |
| ToString | Returns a string that represents the current object. (Inherited from Object.) |

# Properties
| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Axis](d477d77b-1381-2cf6-638c-c21553679422.md "Axis Property") | Axis of the cylinder. This is the Z axis of the local coordinate system associated with this cylinder. |
| [IsValidObject](6429595a-a6e1-2501-1e60-9c53814a9108.md "IsValidObject Property") | Specifies whether the .NET object represents a valid Revit entity.  (Inherited from [Surface](bb391358-5ca0-578d-e8e2-6d1b30c472d8.md "Surface Class").) |
| [OrientationMatchesParametricOrientation](451b549f-2bc4-4f37-9f32-981fe18868a8.md "OrientationMatchesParametricOrientation Property") | Indicates whether this Surface's orientation is the same as or opposite to its parametric orientation.  (Inherited from [Surface](bb391358-5ca0-578d-e8e2-6d1b30c472d8.md "Surface Class").) |
| [Origin](fb029049-10fb-0e2c-5216-813ff9b3e6b3.md "Origin Property") | Center of the circle that defines the base of the cylinder. This is the origin of the local coordinate system associated with this cylinder. |
| [Radius](66115aa4-0b8f-627f-26a5-b6bf2d6f4f1e.md "Radius Property") | Radius of the circle that defines the base of this cylinder. |
| [XDir](6a22ae33-ce30-36e9-6c71-b1a9cb50e858.md "XDir Property") | X axis of the local coordinate system associated with this cylinder. |
| [YDir](f2eacbac-50ab-a937-9d95-062e8bc631d9.md "YDir Property") | Y axis of the local coordinate system associated with this cylinder. |
