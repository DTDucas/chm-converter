# Syntax
C#  
---  
```text
public bool LoadFamily(
	string filename,
	out Family family
)
```
  
Visual Basic

    Type: System..::..StringThe fully qualified filename of the Family file, usually ending in .rfa.
family
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..Family](f51d019d-6ff3-692b-d1d2-b497cab564de.md "Family Class")%A reference to the family that was loaded if successful, otherwise nullNothingnullptra null reference (Nothing in Visual Basic).
# ### Return Value
True if the entire family was loaded successfully into the project, otherwise False.

# Examples
CopyC#
```text
// Get the Revit library path as defined via the Options dialog - File Locations tab - Places button
string libraryPath = "";
application.Application.GetLibraryPaths().TryGetValue("Imperial Library", out libraryPath);

if (String.IsNullOrEmpty(libraryPath))
{
    libraryPath = "c:\\";   // If not have, use a default path.
}

// Allow the user to select a family file.
OpenFileDialog openFileDialog1 = new OpenFileDialog();
openFileDialog1.InitialDirectory = libraryPath;
openFileDialog1.Filter = "Family Files (*.rfa)|*.rfa";

// Load the family file using LoadFamily method and then give information.
if (DialogResult.OK == openFileDialog1.ShowDialog())
{
    Autodesk.Revit.DB.Family family = null;
    if (document.LoadFamily(openFileDialog1.FileName, out family))
    {
        String name = family.Name;
        TaskDialog.Show("Revit","Family file has been loaded. Its name is " + name);
    }
    else
    {
        TaskDialog.Show("Revit","Can't load the family file.");
    }
