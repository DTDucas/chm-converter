# ### Field Value
The longitude, in radians between -PI and PI. If the value is not between -PI and PI, it will be shifted by multiples of 2PI until it is in range. 
# Remarks
A property that contains the longitude of the site location. The value of this property is in radians between +PI and -PI. If the given value is not between -PI and PI, it will be shifted by multiples of 2PI until it is in range.
When setting this property: 
  1. Revit will attempt to match the coordinates to a city it knows about, and if a match is found, will set the name accordingly.
  2. Revit will attempt to automatically adjust the time zone value to match the new Longitude value set using [!:Autodesk::Revit::DB::SunAndShadowSettings::CalculateTimeZone]. For some boundary cases, the time zone calculated may not be correct. You can set the [TimeZone](6718329d-34ff-7d63-173a-c61905639807.md "TimeZone Property") property directly to the correct value if necessary. 
  3. Revit will attempt to automatically update the weather station associated with the coordinates.
