# Methods
| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [AddNonContinuousRail](91ed215d-bf6d-5398-4082-49e35a470785.md "AddNonContinuousRail Method") | Creates and appends a new Non-Continuous Rail to the Rail Structure. The new Non-Continuous Rail will have the given name, height and offset. It will have default profile and material ElementIds. |
| [Dispose](aa43d1bc-a1e9-f338-5b3a-63e38aa1666b.md "Dispose Method") | Releases all resources used by the [NonContinuousRailStructure](a47d9f99-df86-e25b-d24f-635362d065b6.md "NonContinuousRailStructure Class") |
| Equals | Determines whether the specified Object is equal to the current Object. (Inherited from Object.) |
| GetHashCode | Serves as a hash function for a particular type.  (Inherited from Object.) |
| [GetNonContinuousRail](813921fb-3f6c-9db9-a4df-1ddc3dc55fa7.md "GetNonContinuousRail Method") | Gets the Non-Continuous Rail object of specified index from the Rail Structure. |
| [GetNonContinuousRailCount](42c5db6c-e5f8-f7ea-a150-f5f3cfcb40aa.md "GetNonContinuousRailCount Method") | Gets number of Non-Continuous Rails. |
| GetType | Gets the Type of the current instance. (Inherited from Object.) |
| [IsValidNonContinuousRailProfile](6c2ad41d-bba5-3ecb-15d2-09c201727dc3.md "IsValidNonContinuousRailProfile Method") | Checks whether the input id represents a profile which can be used as the profile of this non-continuous rail. |
| [RemoveNonContinuousRail](82518fa5-b6d2-6a69-00bc-19adb1f9c868.md "RemoveNonContinuousRail Method") | Removes Non-Continuous Rail from the Rail Structure. |
| ToString | Returns a string that represents the current object. (Inherited from Object.) |
