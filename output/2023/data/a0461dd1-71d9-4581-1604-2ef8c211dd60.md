# ### Parameters
elementId
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..ElementId](44f3f7b1-3229-3404-93c9-dc5e70337dd6.md "ElementId Class") Id of the element to delete. 
# ### Return Value
The deleted element id set. 
# Remarks
This method will delete the element and any elements that are totally dependent upon that element. Any references to the deleted elements will become invalid and hence cause an exception to be thrown if they are accessed. The elements will be deleted with no prompts for user confirmation. Pinned elements will be deleted with no warnings. 
Note: in a family document, the predefined elements (those elements inherited from its family template file) can't be deleted by this method.
# Examples
CopyC#
```text
private void DeleteElement(Autodesk.Revit.DB.Document document, Element element)
{
    // Delete a selected element.
   ICollection<Autodesk.Revit.DB.ElementId> deletedIdSet = document.Delete(element.Id);

    if (0 == deletedIdSet.Count)
    {
        throw new Exception("Deleting the selected element in Revit failed.");
    }

    String prompt = "The selected element has been removed and ";
    prompt += deletedIdSet.Count - 1;
    prompt += " more dependent elements have also been removed.";

    // Give the user some information
    TaskDialog.Show("Revit",prompt);

}
```

CopyC#
```text
private void DeleteElement(Autodesk.Revit.DB.Document document, Element element)

    ICollection<Autodesk.Revit.DB.ElementId> deletedIdSet = document.Delete(elementId);

    if (0 == deletedIdSet.Count)
    {
        throw new Exception("Deleting the selected element in Revit failed.");
    }

    String prompt = "The selected element has been removed and ";
    prompt += deletedIdSet.Count - 1;
    prompt += " more dependent elements have also been removed.";

    // Give the user some information
    TaskDialog.Show("Revit", prompt);
}
```
