# Syntax
C#  
---  
```text
public void SetActiveServer(
	Guid serverId
)
```
  
Visual Basic  
---  
```text
Public Sub SetActiveServer ( _
	serverId As Guid _
)
```
  
Visual C++  
---  
```text
public:
void SetActiveServer(
	Guid serverId
)
```
  
# ### Parameters
serverId
    Type: System..::..Guid Id of the application server. 
# Remarks
Only one server can be active at any given time in a single-server service, but it is possible that no server is active (unless the service is mandatory). 
An application-wide active server gets executed when the service is invoked in the scope of the entire application (i.e. without a specific document), or if the service is executed in a document but the document does not have an active server explicitly set. 
It is possible to set a server as active when another server is already active for that service. Making a server active will automatically deactivate the server that was active before this call.
