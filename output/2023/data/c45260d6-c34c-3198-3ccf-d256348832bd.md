# ### Parameters
node
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..FaceEdgeNode](66e250b9-081a-5a9b-6045-d779f1876e3a.md "FaceEdgeNode Class") An output node that represents a Face edge. 
# ### Return Value
Return RenderNodeAction.Proceed if you wish to receive tessellated geometry (line or polyline segments) for this face edge, or otherwise return RenderNodeAction.Skip. 
Note: if the export is performed for the view in non-Wireframe display style tesselated geometry will be output regardless of the return value.
# Remarks
Note that this method is invoked only if the custom exporter was set up to include geometric objects in the output stream. See [IncludeGeometricObjects](2ce1075e-380e-01e7-6459-b7467c2a2414.md "IncludeGeometricObjects Property") for mode details.
Note: if the export is performed for the view in non-Wireframe display style this method will be called regardless of whether the object will be eventially output, i.e. even if it's occluded by another element.
