| Success | Indicates curves are valid to use as path base lines for winder run. This is only one flag indicates curves are fine to use as winder path. |
| NumberOutOfRange | The curves number is not 2 or 3. |
| Unbound | Curve is not bound. |
| Noncontinuous | The curves are not continuous in one loop. |
| NotOpenLoop | The curves are not in one open loop. |
| TooShort | Curve length is too short. |
| ColinearOrOverlap | Two curves are collinear or overlap. |
| SelfIntersect | The first curve intersect with third curve. |
| InvalidCurveType | Curve is not line. |
| NotSupported | This path(for zigzag winder) is not supported yet |
