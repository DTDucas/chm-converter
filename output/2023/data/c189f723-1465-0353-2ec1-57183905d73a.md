# Remarks
A document could be opened this way when, for example, at the time of opening the file was being used by another Revit user, or if the disk file has the read-only attribute set. 
Although it will still be possible to modify the opened document, any changes made there will not be possible to save into the original file. If the changes are to be preserved, the document must be saved under a different name using the SaveAs() method.
