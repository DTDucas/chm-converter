CurveLoop..::..IsCounterclockwise Method   
[CurveLoop Class](84824924-cb89-9e20-de6e-3461f429dfd6.md "CurveLoop Class") See Also  
---  
Determines if this CurveLoop is oriented counter-clockwise (CCW) or clockwise (CW) with respect to the specified 3D direction. 
**Namespace:** [Autodesk.Revit.DB](87546ba7-461b-c646-cbb1-2cb8f5bff8b2.md "Autodesk.Revit.DB Namespace")**Assembly:** RevitAPI (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 23.0.0.0 (23.1.0.0)**Since:** 2012 
# Syntax
C#  
---  
```text
public bool IsCounterclockwise(
	XYZ normal
)
```
  
Visual Basic  
---  
```text
Public Function IsCounterclockwise ( _
	normal As XYZ _
) As Boolean
```
  
Visual C++  
---  
```text
public:
bool IsCounterclockwise(
	XYZ^ normal
)
```
  
# ### Parameters
normal
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..XYZ](c2fd995c-95c0-58fb-f5de-f3246cbc5600.md "XYZ Class") The normal vector to the plane used for this determination. 
# ### Return Value
True if the curve loop is oriented counter-clockwise with respect to the specified 3D direction, false if the loop is oriented clockwise. 
# Remarks
CCW means that the projection of the CurveLoop onto a plane having "normal" as its oriented normal is CCW. This method should only be called if the loop is closed and has a non-singular projection onto the plane (i.e., the projection should have no self-intersections and should not be degenerate or even nearly degenerate). The return value in other cases is indeterminate.

| --- | --- |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions..::..ArgumentNullException](631e1424-60f4-929b-4e52-dda9dcd26316.md "ArgumentNullException Class") | A non-optional argument was null |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions..::..InvalidOperationException](9e715f03-3884-e539-4dd6-8d7545733adc.md "InvalidOperationException Class") | The curve loop is open or consists of a single unbound curve; counterclockwise determination has no meaning. |
