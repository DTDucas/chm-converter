# Constructors
| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [FamilyThermalProperties](e8d4c84c-a6f3-197c-080c-25698e042f7b.md "FamilyThermalProperties Constructor") | Constructs a new FamilyThermalProperties with default settings. |

# Methods
| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Dispose](75cde538-cccd-aa5b-9e53-4ec5d5c085d4.md "Dispose Method") | Releases all resources used by the [FamilyThermalProperties](9d9b2125-8398-9b55-8219-cbda4456ab7b.md "FamilyThermalProperties Class") |
| Equals | Determines whether the specified Object is equal to the current Object. (Inherited from Object.) |
| [Find](49d9eee6-8634-3567-7f65-d8e346f7872b.md "Find Method") | Finds the thermal properties by the 'id' property of a constructionType node in Constructions.xml. |
| GetHashCode | Serves as a hash function for a particular type.  (Inherited from Object.) |
| GetType | Gets the Type of the current instance. (Inherited from Object.) |
| [IsValid](c001ea24-7d93-3caf-56c0-d5d4e97a32b0.md "IsValid Method") | Confirms that the thermal properties are correctly set for assignment to a FamilySymbol. |
| ToString | Returns a string that represents the current object. (Inherited from Object.) |

# Properties
| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [AnalyticConstructionName](41f77965-a841-3285-1446-8b3fa732bc05.md "AnalyticConstructionName Property") | The construction gbXML name. This value corresponds to the 'Name' property of a constructionType node in Constructions.xml. |
| [AnalyticConstructionTypeId](d2b7f8c5-b644-2ab8-d168-b60e97513beb.md "AnalyticConstructionTypeId Property") | The construction gbXML type. This value corresponds to the 'id' property of a constructionType node in Constructions.xml. |
| [HeatTransferCoefficient](90d75bb8-07ce-eee9-0995-838c2f1576f1.md "HeatTransferCoefficient Property") | The heat transfer coefficient value (U-Value). The units are watts per meter-squared kelvin (W/(m^2*K)). |
| [IsValidObject](9e7952d4-a28f-0dd9-5357-30c5dbf25748.md "IsValidObject Property") | Specifies whether the .NET object represents a valid Revit entity. |
| [SolarHeatGainCoefficient](345f8aa5-b7bb-f8d8-c7fc-f2ed70fbadbf.md "SolarHeatGainCoefficient Property") | The solar heat gain coefficient. |
| [ThermalResistance](ffd530da-8ea9-738a-078f-077d2806144b.md "ThermalResistance Property") | The calculated thermal resistance value (R-Value). The units are meter-squared kelvin per watt ((m^2*K)/Watt). |
| [VisualLightTransmittance](5ac42661-00c3-2c66-8a1d-0db1a1731217.md "VisualLightTransmittance Property") | The visual light transmittance. |
