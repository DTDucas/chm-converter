# Remarks
Once an instance of this class is created, it can be further modified by calling any of the other methods in any order. It is a specification of a setting for model open; the methods of this class just adjust the specification, and do not themselves open or close worksets. 
Only user-created worksets can be specified to be opened or closed. All system worksets are automatically open. An open workset allows its elements can be expanded and displayed. For a closed workset, Revit tries to not expand its elements, and to that end, does not display them. This is intended to help with performance by reducing Revit's memory footprint.
