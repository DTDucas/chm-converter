# Remarks
A family is parametric if it contains parameter-driven relations between its elements, such as labeled dimensions or locked tangential joins.
Parametric families containing large sketches may cause performance problems. Caution is therefore advised before adding any constraints to a yet non-parametric family that already contains large sketches. See [!:DoesContainLargeSketches()].
