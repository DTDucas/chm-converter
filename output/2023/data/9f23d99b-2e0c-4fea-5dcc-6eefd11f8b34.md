| [NurbsSurfaceData](6fdc9f8a-a443-a69f-2d9b-82cad9bf7544.md "NurbsSurfaceData Constructor") | Copy constructor. |

# Methods
| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Create](94b4c433-5458-d1ab-d5c9-f526f288d1ff.md "Create Method") | Construct NurbsSurfaceData based on NURBS surface data, where the weights are supplied. The NURBS surface will be (piecewise) polynomial if all the weights are equal, rational if not. Note: A rational polynomial is a quotient of two polynomials; this includes a polynomial, which can be thought of as a quotient with denominator equal to 1. |
| [Dispose](27a918fc-a321-7712-4594-9dd7eb2d2140.md "Dispose Method") | Releases all resources used by the [NurbsSurfaceData](7d65dbde-8aac-7d7d-e811-a6c91a541de4.md "NurbsSurfaceData Class") |
| Equals | Determines whether the specified Object is equal to the current Object. (Inherited from Object.) |
| [GetControlPoints](409fe43e-03a5-b9d6-5bf4-4f6427e3606e.md "GetControlPoints Method") | Get the list of control points. |
| GetHashCode | Serves as a hash function for a particular type.  (Inherited from Object.) |
| [GetKnotsU](e280fd98-bad6-3fb3-547f-a829ab23a9de.md "GetKnotsU Method") | Get the list of knots in the u-direction. |
| [GetKnotsV](1b0fea7f-4fd0-bee4-cc1b-773b13b2e36b.md "GetKnotsV Method") | Get the list of knots in the v-direction. |
| GetType | Gets the Type of the current instance. (Inherited from Object.) |
| [GetWeights](a1eec836-1db9-00ef-98eb-923c6a77a952.md "GetWeights Method") | Get the list of weights. |
| [IsValid](6ca835bb-02f9-fe37-01ef-618310cef5ab.md "IsValid Method") | Check if the object contains a valid NurbsSurfaceData. |
| ToString | Returns a string that represents the current object. (Inherited from Object.) |

| [DegreeU](fc2de49b-75ef-b407-cecf-3dd0199b775a.md "DegreeU Property") | The degree of the spline in the u-direction. |
| [DegreeV](7bc890a0-c3d3-8e7f-5d9d-148a69de4813.md "DegreeV Property") | The degree of the spline in the v-direction. |
| [IsRational](da17256f-3c20-22c0-1619-5fe2d847752a.md "IsRational Property") | Tells if the spline is rational or not. If it is true (rational), then the NURBS is a piecewise rational polynomial function. If it is false (non-rational), then the NURBS is a piecewise polynomial function. |
| [IsValidObject](b9517067-344b-5d1b-8c5d-664b7e7115e1.md "IsValidObject Property") | Specifies whether the .NET object represents a valid Revit entity. |
| [ReverseOrientation](57ca8156-bae7-58fc-89a4-88f08aa1f756.md "ReverseOrientation Property") | If true, the surface's orientation is opposite to the canonical parametric orientation, otherwise it is the same. The canonical parametric orientation is a counter-clockwise sense of rotation in the uv-parameter plane. Extrinsically, the oriented normal vector for the canonical parametric orientation points in the direction of the cross product dS/du x dS/dv, which S(u, v) is the parameterized surface. |
