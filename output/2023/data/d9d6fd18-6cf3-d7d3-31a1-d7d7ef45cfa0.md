# ### Parameters
baseEquipmentConnector
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..Connector](11e07082-b3f2-26a1-de79-16535f44716c.md "Connector Class") One connector within base equipment which is used to connect with the system. The base equipment is optional for the system, so this argument may be nullNothingnullptra null reference (Nothing in Visual Basic). The baseEquipmentConnector should not be included in the connectors. 
connectors
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..ConnectorSet](a9821fc1-54cf-5f69-13a9-25d506ecb048.md "ConnectorSet Class") Connectors that will connect to the system. The owner elements of these connectors will be added into system as its elements. 
ductSystemType
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB.Mechanical..::..DuctSystemType](108631a7-6d3a-a5f6-cc0c-0579ca8cf999.md "DuctSystemType Enumeration")The system type.
# ### Return Value
If creation was successful then an instance of mechanical system is returned, otherwise an exception with information will be thrown. 
# Remarks
This method will regenerate the document even in manual regeneration mode.
