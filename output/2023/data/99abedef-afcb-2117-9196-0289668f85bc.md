# ### Parameters
newGeometry
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..Solid](7a3b5ac1-c66d-9f81-a11d-9bcd4e026295.md "Solid Class") The new geometry to set in the FreeForm element. 
# Remarks
Rules for preserving References: 
  * First preserve faces as Reference when exclusively coincident with existing faces.
  * Then preserve faces as Reference if exclusively parallel to existing faces.
  * Then preserve faces as Reference if exclusive at small angle to the existing faces.
  * Any other faces are will not be preserved as a Reference.

Edges are preserved as References if and only if exclusively bound to faces that are also preserved as References.
