# ### Return Value
True if the workset can be deleted, false otherwise. 
# Remarks
The workset can't be deleted in the following cases: 
  * The input worksetId is not valid in the document. 
  * The input worksetId doesn't represent a user-created workset, which means this workset might be a system workset. 
  * The workset is not editable by the current user. In order to resolve this problem, please checkout the workset by calling [!:Autodesk::Revit::DB::WorksharingUtils::CheckoutWorksets]. 
  * The workset or some elements under the workset are owned by the other users. In order to resolve this problem, please ask the other users to call [!:Autodesk::Revit::DB::WorksharingUtils::RelinquishOwnership] to relinquish their ownership on the workset and elements. 
  * The target workset is not a user-created workset.
