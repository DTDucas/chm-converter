# Remarks
A compound structure consists a collection of ordered layers, proceeding from exterior to interior for a wall, or from top to bottom for a floor, roof or ceiling. The properties of these layers determine the thickness, material, and function of the overall structure of the associated wall, floor, roof or ceiling. Layers can be accessed via the [GetLayers()()()()](105b59e9-9cea-1988-a5a7-cc9cde49145c.md "GetLayers Method") method and completely replaced using SetLayers. Layers can also be accessed and modified individually using the "layer index", which is a value from in the range [0, LayerCount) identifying the layer in the structure. 
A structure supports the concept of "core layers" and "shell layers". There are two layer indices which identify where the boundary between core and shell layers occur in the list of layers. The boundaries between shell and core layers are identifiable using [GetFirstCoreLayerIndex()()()()](db2884a9-bd2a-e7be-eb95-d8dd5e74ee59.md "GetFirstCoreLayerIndex Method"), [GetLastCoreLayerIndex()()()()](4e32008c-8d6a-5368-a4d9-4e3e103bce9d.md "GetLastCoreLayerIndex Method"), [GetCoreBoundaryLayerIndex(ShellLayerType)](33a4b0ce-7694-bf4f-81a0-a8b66fa3cade.md "GetCoreBoundaryLayerIndex Method") or [GetNumberOfShellLayers(ShellLayerType)](68e04211-03ea-f0c6-50d5-b38fee4e7536.md "GetNumberOfShellLayers Method"). The core layer boundary can be changed with [SetNumberOfShellLayers(ShellLayerType, Int32)](8b8ea4e3-e697-6176-92c0-dc2687723a71.md "SetNumberOfShellLayers Method"). 
Compound structures may be vertically compound. If [IsVerticallyCompound](cd352f22-8ca4-b3b6-f247-d9865a91bb6f.md "IsVerticallyCompound Property") is false, the CompoundStructure describes a series of parallel layers, each with specified width, function, material and other properties. If [IsVerticallyCompound](cd352f22-8ca4-b3b6-f247-d9865a91bb6f.md "IsVerticallyCompound Property") is true (which should apply only for CompoundStructures assigned to walls) then horizontal sections at different elevations may have different layered structures. In this case, the structure describes a vertical section via a rectangle which is divided into polygonal regions whose sides are all vertical or horizontal segments. A map associates each of these regions with the index of a layer in the CompoundStructure which determines the properties of that region.
