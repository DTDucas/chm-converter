# Remarks
The ScheduleField class represents a single field in a ScheduleDefinition's list of fields. Each (non-hidden) field becomes a column in the schedule.
Most commonly, a field represents an instance or type parameter of elements appearing in the schedule. Some fields represent parameters of other related elements, like the room that a scheduled element belongs to. Fields can also represent data calculated from other fields in the schedule, specifically Formula and Percentage fields.
