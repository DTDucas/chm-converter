# Methods
| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [AddBarGeometry(IList<(Of <<'(Curve>)>>))](674f12da-e4a0-fc7f-b011-a706c7859d40.md "AddBarGeometry Method \(IList\(Curve\)\)") | Adds a new rebar geometry. This information is set to the rebar after the API execution is finished successfully. |
| [AddBarGeometry(CurveLoop)](9948f497-0cdc-b3b6-a465-b7fe4e843da2.md "AddBarGeometry Method \(CurveLoop\)") | Adds a new rebar geometry. This information is set to the rebar after the API execution is finished successfully. |
| [CanAddBarGeometry](4dc39ffe-585f-9f4f-725c-5269d71bfc1e.md "CanAddBarGeometry Method") | Returns true if getNumberOfBarGeometry() is less than GetNumberOfBars(), false otherwise. |
| [ClearAllAddedBarGeometry](f1450c93-30ed-79cf-0acd-3619cb170428.md "ClearAllAddedBarGeometry Method") | This function will remove all bars geometry that were added by calling AddBarGeometry(). |
| [CreateEndConstraint](30f97bb3-ad2e-6240-6222-afa70754f1f3.md "CreateEndConstraint Method") | Creates a constraint for the end handle of the rebar. This constraint will be set preferred after the API execution is finished successfully. |
| [CreateStartConstraint](d4a71afa-9ebd-fc3d-6b74-79180843f086.md "CreateStartConstraint Method") | Creates a constraint for the start handle of the rebar. This constraint will be set preferred after the API execution is finished successfully. |
| [Dispose](030e9c7c-7be8-8554-751e-9cffc4264b8b.md "Dispose Method") | Releases all resources used by the [RebarTrimExtendData](980b816d-dc7e-7550-3e37-61482516b5ab.md "RebarTrimExtendData Class") |
| Equals | Determines whether the specified Object is equal to the current Object. (Inherited from Object.) |
| [GetAddedBarGeometry](64c06ae1-86b7-4e86-94df-2a6d99084a11.md "GetAddedBarGeometry Method") | Gets the added curves that will represent the bar at index barIndex. |
| GetHashCode | Serves as a hash function for a particular type.  (Inherited from Object.) |
| [GetNumberOfBarGeometry](58c19b83-13ae-de95-4950-aefa2873f687.md "GetNumberOfBarGeometry Method") | Gets the number of Bar Geometry that were added. |
| [GetRebarUpdateCurvesData](64b5059a-5cfe-bf9a-b13c-dea51ff40449.md "GetRebarUpdateCurvesData Method") | Gets a class that contains information used as input and output for rebar free form calculation. |
| GetType | Gets the Type of the current instance. (Inherited from Object.) |
| ToString | Returns a string that represents the current object. (Inherited from Object.) |

# Properties
| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [IsValidObject](d6ff953d-24a5-5d33-cb47-0718a6edb20a.md "IsValidObject Property") | Specifies whether the .NET object represents a valid Revit entity. |
