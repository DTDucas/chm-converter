| [CapsWereAddedWarning](b6970f67-7480-626c-1c03-c81d48751611.md "CapsWereAddedWarning Property") | X caps were added. |
| [CapWasAddedWarning](3afc8d1b-7c97-851f-0d1b-95d6daf88ba0.md "CapWasAddedWarning Property") | 1 cap was added. |
| [FailedToPlaceCapWarning](a313048f-52a9-ef90-eef9-16f3241705ed.md "FailedToPlaceCapWarning Property") | Failed to place cap on the open connector. |
| [FlowConfigMismatch](a7d72e26-4e44-9690-e295-c133f32b1763.md "FlowConfigMismatch Property") | [Element Name]: It is not possible to calculate the flow since all the components in this system have the flow configuration set to Preset or System. At least one component is required to have the flow configuration set to Calculated. |
| [FlowDirectionMismatch](ec164586-731b-6990-0490-cda3a35cde6e.md "FlowDirectionMismatch Property") | [Element Name]: It is not possible to calculate the flow since the flow direction mismatch. Please check flow direction on all equipment in this system. |
| [InlineEndoflineMismatch](1ffefe1e-9331-e2e7-5437-60983deea1d6.md "InlineEndoflineMismatch Property") | [Element Name]: It is not possible to calculate the flow since there is inline equipment that is configured as end of line. Please check equipment in this system and make sure that the equipment connectors used inline have a global system classification and a calculated flow configuration. Global equipment connectors used inline should always be linked to each other. |
| [MaxWidthAndHeightReached](8e718c6b-7d65-568b-1788-9c6868a5b8dc.md "MaxWidthAndHeightReached Property") | Maximum width and height reached during sizing |
| [SegmentIsTooShort](436e0452-d460-2c85-2d83-e65ac9677602.md "SegmentIsTooShort Property") | The segment is too short. |
| [SizingFailedZeroFlow](38b69fca-982d-bf98-8f08-ef55d957c4a4.md "SizingFailedZeroFlow Property") | Sizing failed. Flow for section is 0. |
| [ValidatePHSegmentConnWarning](e9f77cc8-e22c-9385-4034-f1f090235127.md "ValidatePHSegmentConnWarning Property") | The placeholder curve will not be able to connect to the required fittings for placeholder convert |
| [ValidatePHSegmentLengthWarning](56aff7ee-4f46-8063-afbf-17649c7c667d.md "ValidatePHSegmentLengthWarning Property") | The placeholder curve is not long enough to support the required fittings for placeholder convert |
