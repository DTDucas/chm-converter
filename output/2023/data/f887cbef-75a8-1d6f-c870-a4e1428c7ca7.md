Provides a container of all Revit built-in FailureDefinitionId instances.
The [BuiltInFailures..::..SiteImportFailures](8f9298be-9e12-d84b-8459-c862355e698d.md "BuiltInFailures.SiteImportFailures Class") type exposes the following members.
# Properties
| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [BoundaryDetectError](8c8c3bba-c6e1-d8ee-6738-d87fc72f527d.md "BoundaryDetectError Property") | A boundary on this surface could not be autodetected. Revit will impose one, but it may be larger than you want. |
| [ContoursNoncontours](cf2149e8-42af-69b5-8e41-1aef52548631.md "ContoursNoncontours Property") | The layers you have selected contain both contour lines and non-contour lines (lines of non-constant elevation). You may want to go back and select fewer layers, or you can continue, but the boundary of the site may be larger than you want. |
| [DifferentEntityTypes](1202ad11-8794-1d55-f063-c42e56caec57.md "DifferentEntityTypes Property") | Can't auto-detect boundary. The layers selected contain data that may make the Toposurface look incorrect. For better results, try selecting only those layers that contain relevant 3D info. |
| [NoPoints](7bbef7e2-44ac-abf4-51f0-4084369adeae.md "NoPoints Property") | No points were found in the file. |
| [NoViewSpecificSiteImports](c4533c3c-8581-2f27-cf02-ea960a87e4a9.md "NoViewSpecificSiteImports Property") | Can't make Toposurface from View Specific Imports. |
| [SurfaceExists](3e47440a-9d7f-5ca8-4773-3851d8efa999.md "SurfaceExists Property") | You are importing data into a surface that already contains points. You may want to go back, create a new surface, and import the data into that instead. You can continue, and Revit will sew the meshes together, but the boundary may be larger than you want. |
| [TooFarAway](bd99be6a-646b-59c3-c69b-75f8b4d0b34a.md "TooFarAway Property") | Imported Toposurface Points are located a large distance from the model and might not display properly. Points will be centered on the model instead. |
| [TooLarge](c991d035-dd20-aeb4-c500-7f10ca5bfc8f.md "TooLarge Property") | There are too many points on the selected layers of this dataset to place into the toposurface. Try selecting fewer layers to create the surface |
| [TooManyMeshes](0f1d4267-f6b9-56a1-c4ee-cf1489e335cb.md "TooManyMeshes Property") | The layers you have selected contain more than one mesh. You may want to go back and import the meshes separately. If you continue, the meshes will be combined and a new boundary will be created. |
| [UnusedPoints](7ddd17c9-1d02-c172-ea56-b684505abe0a.md "UnusedPoints Property") | Some rows from the file could not be used. |
