# Remarks
In a perspective view, view direction is variable - it is the direction that connects a particular point on the model with the eye position. The property [ViewDirection](822149b4-d843-3370-286b-c3bc8c82abff.md "ViewDirection Property") becomes less meaningful - it only describes the general orientation of the camera.
