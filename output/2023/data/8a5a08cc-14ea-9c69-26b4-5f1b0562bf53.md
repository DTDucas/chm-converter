Creates a copy of a definition shape that was created earlier.

	document As Document, _
	definition_id As String, _
	trf As Transform _
) As IList(Of GeometryObject)

# ### Parameters
document
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..Document](db03274b-a107-aa32-9034-f3e0df4bb1ec.md "Document Class") Document to which the created element will be added 
definition_id
    Type: System..::..String ID of the shape definition that was created earlier and stored via DirectShapeLibrary 
trf
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..Transform](58dd01c8-b3fc-7142-e4f3-c524079a282d.md "Transform Class") Transform to be applied to the definition 
# ### Return Value
A collection of GeometryObjects representing a placed instance of the pre-defined shape The caller function takes ownership 
# Remarks
Use DirectShapeLibrary class to store definitions prior to using them here. How the definitions are stored will determine whether an instance or a copy of the shape will be created. Use the output of this function as input to CreateElement to make the created shape persistent. This is intended to support a definition/instance pattern common in CAD formats - DWG blocks, STEP MAPPED_ITEM, IFC IfcMappedItem.
