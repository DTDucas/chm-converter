public:
void SetCropShape(
	CurveLoop^ boundary

# ### Parameters
boundary
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..CurveLoop](84824924-cb89-9e20-de6e-3461f429dfd6.md "CurveLoop Class") The crop boundary. 
# Remarks
Depending on the shape of the argument, view's crop is set to be either rectangular or non-rectangular. If the crop is set to be rectangular and it is also split, then the multiple view regions will be displayed for the view, with the same proportions as the split prior to the change, but adjusted to the new rectangular shape. 
This Method is reserved for setting crop shape in views that allow non-rectangular crop shapes - see property [CanHaveShape](4ed96171-c8ac-1623-f1d3-5da38d1bd834.md "CanHaveShape Property"). For views that don't allow non-rectangular crop shapes (e.g. [View3D](d795a238-fc24-1875-e64f-a2bef56ae949.md "View3D Class")), please use property [CropBox](d6246051-ecfb-7388-0429-6ed65de72638.md "CropBox Property") for that purpose.
