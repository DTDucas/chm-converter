# Methods
| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [AddCutBetweenSolids(Document, Element, Element)](eb10c2f6-4d13-0437-12aa-06be28c1b927.md "AddCutBetweenSolids Method \(Document, Element, Element\)") | Adds a solid-solid cut for the two elements. |
| [AddCutBetweenSolids(Document, Element, Element, Boolean)](eb640bff-a6be-d931-afbf-df3bc7a1a869.md "AddCutBetweenSolids Method \(Document, Element, Element, Boolean\)") | Adds a solid-solid cut for the two elements with the option to control splitting of faces of the cutting solid. |
| [CanElementCutElement](c5628c5f-d01a-8934-fc8f-fa3e73bea59d.md "CanElementCutElement Method") | Verifies if the cutting element can add a solid cut to the target element. |
| [CutExistsBetweenElements](ebe4f477-2aad-2523-570e-1f3dcff46f78.md "CutExistsBetweenElements Method") | Checks that if there is a solid-solid cut between two elements. |
| [GetCuttingSolids](ca21c6c1-7689-1a1e-f370-219eba29b8ff.md "GetCuttingSolids Method") | Gets all the solids which cut the input element. |
| [GetSolidsBeingCut](4b8c8902-2a32-b99c-aa0e-e3abd79d9073.md "GetSolidsBeingCut Method") | Get all the solids which are cut by the input element. |
| [IsAllowedForSolidCut](1fe7758b-d702-2dbc-f3a7-33b1be9b26de.md "IsAllowedForSolidCut Method") | Validates that the element is eligible for a solid-solid cut. |
| [IsElementFromAppropriateContext](d99d08e0-d818-ce6a-2a21-a083664affa8.md "IsElementFromAppropriateContext Method") | Validates that the element is from an appropriate document. |
| [RemoveCutBetweenSolids](dc614d7b-5a07-4d65-dd58-ed78c9d3cb2a.md "RemoveCutBetweenSolids Method") | Removes the solid-solid cut between the two elements if it exists. |
| [SplitFacesOfCuttingSolid](7c6d00a4-616b-0828-27cc-d4f117e5d561.md "SplitFacesOfCuttingSolid Method") | Causes the faces of the cutting element where it intersects the element it is cutting to be split or unsplit. |
