# ### Parameters
serverId
    Type: System..::..Guid Id of the server to be unregistered. 
# Remarks
Only servers that have not been used yet (executed) in any still open document are allowed to be removed. This applies to servers used in the current session or previous sessions. 
It is possible to remove servers that are currently set as active, because it is possible for a service to have no active server assigned. This does not apply to mandatory services, which will always have at least one server registered - the default server - and at least one server set as active at all times. 
A server cannot be removed during the service's execution or when another server is just being added or removed (e.g. during OnServersChanged call-back to the service). 
Default server may not be removed. An attempt to do so will lead to an exception.
