[Members](d174f86b-5f18-6921-da06-4e22cc3cf38b.md "BoundingBoxIsInsideFilter Members") Example See Also  
---  
A filter used to match elements with a bounding box that is contained by the given Outline. 
**Namespace:** [Autodesk.Revit.DB](87546ba7-461b-c646-cbb1-2cb8f5bff8b2.md "Autodesk.Revit.DB Namespace")**Assembly:** RevitAPI (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 23.0.0.0 (23.1.0.0)**Since:** 2011 
# Syntax
C#  
---  
```text
public class BoundingBoxIsInsideFilter : ElementQuickFilter
```
  
Visual Basic  
---  
```text
Public Class BoundingBoxIsInsideFilter _
	Inherits ElementQuickFilter
```
  
Visual C++

```text
public ref class BoundingBoxIsInsideFilter : public ElementQuickFilter
```
  
# Remarks
This filter excludes all objects derived from View and objects derived from ElementType. This filter is a quick filter. Quick filters operate only on the ElementRecord, a low-memory class which has a limited interface to read element properties. Elements which are rejected by a quick filter will not be expanded in memory. 
# Examples
CopyC#
```text
// Use BoundingBoxIsInside filter to find elements with a bounding box that is contained(inside completely) 
// by the given Outline in the document.

// Create a Outline, use a minimum and maximum XYZ point to initialize the outline. 
Outline myOutLn = new Outline(new XYZ(0, 0, 0), new XYZ(100, 100, 100));

// Create a BoundingBoxIsInside filter for Outline
BoundingBoxIsInsideFilter filter = new BoundingBoxIsInsideFilter(myOutLn);

// Apply the filter to the elements in the active document
// This filter excludes all objects derived from View and objects derived from ElementType
FilteredElementCollector collector = new FilteredElementCollector(document);
IList<Element> elements = collector.WherePasses(filter).ToElements();

// Find walls outside BoundingBox: use an inverted filter to match elements
// Use shortcut command OfClass() to find walls only
BoundingBoxIsInsideFilter outsideFilter = new BoundingBoxIsInsideFilter(myOutLn, true); // inverted filter
collector = new FilteredElementCollector(document);
IList<Element> outsideFounds = collector.OfClass(typeof(Wall)).WherePasses(outsideFilter).ToElements();
```
