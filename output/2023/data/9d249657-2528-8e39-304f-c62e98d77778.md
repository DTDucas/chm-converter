# Remarks
Result is based on the ExportComplexity setting. The method described by gbs/gbxml.org to calculate the shading surfaces is to take all surfaces from the MEP spaces, subtract them from the surfaces from all building elements, and then the remaining surfaces are considered to be the shading surfaces.
