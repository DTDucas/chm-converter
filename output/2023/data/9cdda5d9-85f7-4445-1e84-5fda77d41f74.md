# ### Parameters
location
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..XYZ](c2fd995c-95c0-58fb-f5de-f3246cbc5600.md "XYZ Class")The physical location where the instance is to be placed.
symbol
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..FamilySymbol](a1acaed0-6a62-4c1d-94f5-4e27ce0923d3.md "FamilySymbol Class")A FamilySymbol object that represents the type of the instance that is to be inserted.
level
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..Level](577e5d4e-a558-118c-9dea-3b810b061775.md "Level Class")A Level object that is used as the base level for the object.
structuralType
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB.Structure..::..StructuralType](0a0a3793-5fce-283d-4953-a137f5593db9.md "StructuralType Enumeration") If structural then specify the type of the component. 
# ### Return Value
If creation was successful then an instance to the new object is returned, otherwise nullNothingnullptra null reference (Nothing in Visual Basic).
# Remarks
This method is used to add a family instance that doesn't require a host element, but that can be associated to a level. If the instance fails to be created an exception may be thrown. 
The type/symbol that is used must be loaded into the document before this method is called. Families and their symbols can be loaded using the Document.LoadFamily or Document.LoadFamilySymbol methods. 
All levels within the document can be found by iterating over the entire document and searching for objects of type Autodesk.Revit.Elements.Level.
Some families, such as Beams, have more than one endpoint and are inserted in the same manner as single point instances. Once inserted these linear family instances can have their endpoints changed by using the instance's Element.Location property.
Note: if the created family instance includes nested instances, the API framework will automatically regenerate the document during this method call.
# Examples
CopyC#
```text
FamilyInstance CreateColumn(Autodesk.Revit.DB.Document document, Level level)
{
    // Get a Column type from Revit
    FilteredElementCollector collector = new FilteredElementCollector(document);
    collector.OfClass(typeof(FamilySymbol)).OfCategory(BuiltInCategory.OST_StructuralColumns);
    FamilySymbol columnType = collector.FirstElement() as FamilySymbol;

    FamilyInstance instance = null;
    if (null != columnType)
    {
        // Create a column at the origin
        XYZ origin = new XYZ(0, 0, 0);

        instance = document.Create.NewFamilyInstance(origin, columnType, level, StructuralType.Column);
    }

    return instance;
}
```

CopyVB.NET
```text
Private Function CreateColumn(document As Autodesk.Revit.DB.Document, level As Level) As FamilyInstance
    ' Get a Column type from Revit
    Dim collector As New FilteredElementCollector(document)
    collector.OfClass(GetType(FamilySymbol)).OfCategory(BuiltInCategory.OST_StructuralColumns)
    Dim columnType As FamilySymbol = TryCast(collector.FirstElement(), FamilySymbol)

    Dim instance As FamilyInstance = Nothing
    If columnType IsNot Nothing Then
        ' Create a column at the origin
        Dim origin As New XYZ(0, 0, 0)

        instance = document.Create.NewFamilyInstance(origin, columnType, level, StructuralType.Column)
    End If

    Return instance
End Function
```
