BRepBuilder..::..AddFace Method   
[BRepBuilder Class](94c1fef4-2933-ce67-9c2d-361cbf8a42b4.md "BRepBuilder Class") See Also  
---  
Creates an empty face in the geometry being built. Other BRepBuilder methods are used to add loops to the face. 
**Namespace:** [Autodesk.Revit.DB](87546ba7-461b-c646-cbb1-2cb8f5bff8b2.md "Autodesk.Revit.DB Namespace")**Assembly:** RevitAPI (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 23.0.0.0 (23.1.0.0)**Since:** 2016 
# Syntax

	BRepBuilderSurfaceGeometry surfaceGeom,
	bool bFaceIsReversed
)

```text
Public Function AddFace ( _
	surfaceGeom As BRepBuilderSurfaceGeometry, _
	bFaceIsReversed As Boolean _

BRepBuilderGeometryId^ AddFace(
	BRepBuilderSurfaceGeometry^ surfaceGeom, 
	bool bFaceIsReversed
)
```
  
# ### Parameters
surfaceGeom
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..BRepBuilderSurfaceGeometry](c21d4101-cc15-1990-ee9f-994b487bf95d.md "BRepBuilderSurfaceGeometry Class") The face's support surface. 
bFaceIsReversed
    Type: System..::..Boolean True if the face's orientation is opposite to that of the surface, false if the orientations agree. The faces of each shell must be consistently oriented. For a solid (BRepType == Solid), the oriented face normals must point out of the solid; for a void (BRepType == Void), the face normals must point into the void. See the description of the bCoEdgeIsReversed input for AddCoEdge() for a discussion of the loop and co-edge orientation conventions to use with the BRepBuilder. 
# ### Return Value
An id that can be used to identify the face while the BRepBuilder is actively building geometry (e.g., to add a loop to a face).
