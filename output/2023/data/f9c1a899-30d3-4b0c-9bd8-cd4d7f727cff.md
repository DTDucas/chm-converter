The [NurbsSurfaceData](7d65dbde-8aac-7d7d-e811-a6c91a541de4.md "NurbsSurfaceData Class") type exposes the following members.
# Properties
| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [DegreeU](fc2de49b-75ef-b407-cecf-3dd0199b775a.md "DegreeU Property") | The degree of the spline in the u-direction. |
| [DegreeV](7bc890a0-c3d3-8e7f-5d9d-148a69de4813.md "DegreeV Property") | The degree of the spline in the v-direction. |
| [IsRational](da17256f-3c20-22c0-1619-5fe2d847752a.md "IsRational Property") | Tells if the spline is rational or not. If it is true (rational), then the NURBS is a piecewise rational polynomial function. If it is false (non-rational), then the NURBS is a piecewise polynomial function. |
| [IsValidObject](b9517067-344b-5d1b-8c5d-664b7e7115e1.md "IsValidObject Property") | Specifies whether the .NET object represents a valid Revit entity. |
| [ReverseOrientation](57ca8156-bae7-58fc-89a4-88f08aa1f756.md "ReverseOrientation Property") | If true, the surface's orientation is opposite to the canonical parametric orientation, otherwise it is the same. The canonical parametric orientation is a counter-clockwise sense of rotation in the uv-parameter plane. Extrinsically, the oriented normal vector for the canonical parametric orientation points in the direction of the cross product dS/du x dS/dv, which S(u, v) is the parameterized surface. |
