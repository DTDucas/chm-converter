# ### Return Value
True if the transaction has already started, False otherwise. 
# Remarks
A transaction is considered being started after a 'Start' method was called and until the transaction is either completely committed or rolled back. 
HasStarted may return True even after 'Commit' or 'RollBack' was called if the method returned the TransactionStatus.Pending value.
A transaction can only be Started when HasStarted returns false.
