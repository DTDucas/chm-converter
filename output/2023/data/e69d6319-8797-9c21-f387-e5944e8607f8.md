| [AlignmentStationLabelOptions](ff2d6432-d624-692e-eb82-dcc98801b3b6.md "AlignmentStationLabelOptions Constructor") | Creates an object with default values. |

# Methods
| Name | Description |

| --- | --- | --- |
| Equals | Determines whether the specified Object is equal to the current Object. (Inherited from Object.) |
| GetHashCode | Serves as a hash function for a particular type.  (Inherited from Object.) |
| GetType | Gets the Type of the current instance. (Inherited from Object.) |
| ToString | Returns a string that represents the current object. (Inherited from Object.) |

# Properties

| [HasLeader](2cd13188-00bb-784f-17dd-b2c130f34b08.md "HasLeader Property") | Specifies if the label will have a leader. The default value is true. |
| [LeaderEnd](e6e365cc-fc8c-31e2-a604-14ecf78c6374.md "LeaderEnd Property") | Specifies the leader end point, in model coordinates. The default value is null. When null, the end point will be the same as the [Origin](df8b9dc6-9d36-ac2b-04cf-816d88f039b8.md "Origin Property") point, driven by the [Station](215afd0a-ff0e-1a8e-fc74-be36e7ad4d77.md "Station Property") value. |
| [LeaderShoulder](e2c8a9bd-31cd-3ff8-2aa2-90adb02493cc.md "LeaderShoulder Property") | Specifies the leader shoulder point, in model coordinates. The default value is null. When null, the shoulder point will be the same as the [Origin](df8b9dc6-9d36-ac2b-04cf-816d88f039b8.md "Origin Property") point, driven by the [Station](215afd0a-ff0e-1a8e-fc74-be36e7ad4d77.md "Station Property") value. |
| [Station](215afd0a-ff0e-1a8e-fc74-be36e7ad4d77.md "Station Property") | Specifies the station at which the label will be placed, in Revit internal model units (standard Imperial feet). The station determines the location of the label's origin: [Origin](df8b9dc6-9d36-ac2b-04cf-816d88f039b8.md "Origin Property") by setting it to the closest point on the alignment geometry which corresponds to this station. |
| [TypeId](86352cb2-b367-a806-7427-2fb08e50b425.md "TypeId Property") | Specifies the ElementId of the label type. The default value is InvalidElementId. In this case, the default type id for alignment station labels in the document is used. |
