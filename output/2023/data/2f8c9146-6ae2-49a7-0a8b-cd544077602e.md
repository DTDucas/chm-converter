| Success | The load operation was successful. |
| Failure | The load operation failed. |
| Uninitialized | The load operation is in an incomplete state. Revit will treat this result as a failure. |
| ResourceAlreadyCurrent | The current version of the resource is already loaded into Revit so no changes were made to the model. |
| CannotFindServer | The server identified by the ExternalResourceReference could not be found, and may not be registered. |
| ServerThrewException | The server identified by the ExternalResourceReference threw an exception while attempting to load a resource. |

# Remarks
This flag is returned by the LoadResource method of the IExternalResourceServer class to inform callers whether the load operation succeeded, or encountered an error.
