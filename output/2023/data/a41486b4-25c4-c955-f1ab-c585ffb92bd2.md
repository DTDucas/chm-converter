A constraint that measures the length of a segment as measured by projecting onto a direction that is not parallel to the segment.

# Syntax

# Remarks
The constraint has two references, indexed by 0 and 1, that do not have to correspond to the start and end of the segment. The constraint also specifies a direction as a 2D vector, which is not necessarily parallel to the segment, but must point from the segment's start toward its end.
