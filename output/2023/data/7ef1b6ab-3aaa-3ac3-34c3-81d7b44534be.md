| [BoundingBoxIntersectsFilter(Outline)](3a1c089f-082f-e0f6-fc80-68a3c60db8ef.md "BoundingBoxIntersectsFilter Constructor \(Outline\)") | Constructs a new instance of a filter to match elements with a bounding box that intersects the given Outline. |
| [BoundingBoxIntersectsFilter(Outline, Boolean)](608e7bd7-432c-9b73-de4f-d17d8aa6cce3.md "BoundingBoxIntersectsFilter Constructor \(Outline, Boolean\)") | Constructs a new instance of a filter to match elements with a bounding box that intersects the given Outline, with the option to invert the filter and match all elements with a bounding box that are not intersecting the given Outline. |
| [BoundingBoxIntersectsFilter(Outline, Double)](12de85f3-3aa7-fcb9-eda1-7744b052e442.md "BoundingBoxIntersectsFilter Constructor \(Outline, Double\)") | Constructs a new instance of a filter to match elements with a bounding box that intersects the given Outline. |
| [BoundingBoxIntersectsFilter(Outline, Double, Boolean)](be97c617-d4b7-54d8-545e-a3fd9647f73c.md "BoundingBoxIntersectsFilter Constructor \(Outline, Double, Boolean\)") | Constructs a new instance of a filter to match elements with a bounding box that intersects the given Outline, with the option to invert the filter and match all elements with a bounding box that are not intersecting the given Outline. |

| --- | --- | --- |
| [Dispose](5d3ffdf8-dce9-0724-d101-44693775671c.md "Dispose Method") | (Inherited from [ElementFilter](b8b46cbf-9ecc-0745-ec53-c3c3b6510113.md "ElementFilter Class").) |
| Equals | Determines whether the specified Object is equal to the current Object. (Inherited from Object.) |
| [GetBoundingBox](2b287737-ceae-f54f-fccf-7012fd9b6703.md "GetBoundingBox Method") | Gets the outline being used for this filter. |
| GetHashCode | Serves as a hash function for a particular type.  (Inherited from Object.) |
| GetType | Gets the Type of the current instance. (Inherited from Object.) |
| [PassesFilter(Element)](1402f6e0-995c-2644-c7a9-7016a81a4ef4.md "PassesFilter Method \(Element\)") | Applies the filter to a given element.  (Inherited from [ElementFilter](b8b46cbf-9ecc-0745-ec53-c3c3b6510113.md "ElementFilter Class").) |
| [PassesFilter(Document, ElementId)](a8e86084-b91f-c3cf-c334-e163168328d6.md "PassesFilter Method \(Document, ElementId\)") | Applies the filter to a given element.  (Inherited from [ElementFilter](b8b46cbf-9ecc-0745-ec53-c3c3b6510113.md "ElementFilter Class").) |
| ToString | Returns a string that represents the current object. (Inherited from Object.) |

# Properties
| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Inverted](ceab2eea-cc4c-d7dc-b34c-b3c1f012eda1.md "Inverted Property") | True if the results of the filter are inverted; elements that would normally be accepted by this filter will be rejected, and elements that would normally be rejected will be accepted.  (Inherited from [ElementFilter](b8b46cbf-9ecc-0745-ec53-c3c3b6510113.md "ElementFilter Class").) |
| [IsValidObject](027ccc75-b7f6-4ee2-cf98-563df96b0dbb.md "IsValidObject Property") | Specifies whether the .NET object represents a valid Revit entity.  (Inherited from [ElementFilter](b8b46cbf-9ecc-0745-ec53-c3c3b6510113.md "ElementFilter Class").) |
| [Tolerance](2c9269cc-09c6-576a-ddf9-7f0599088944.md "Tolerance Property") | Allows control over the match criteria by using a tolerance in the geometry comparison. It is suggested to use this in cases where trivial differences should be considered when matching elements. |
