# Remarks
Symbols that are not used in the document may be deactivated to conserve memory and regeneration time. When the symbol is inactive, its geometry is empty and should not be accessed. In order to access geometry of a symbol that is not active in the document, first check its [IsActive](69706e35-87cc-a6d9-68fe-90a41c1c48db.md "IsActive Property") property. Note that until the document is regenerated, the newly activated symbol's geometry will still be empty.
