Moves a point in a TopographySurface to a new designated location. 
**Namespace:** [Autodesk.Revit.DB.Architecture](720f0c58-cb2b-4f13-374a-7348ed0a1cd3.md "Autodesk.Revit.DB.Architecture Namespace")**Assembly:** RevitAPI (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 23.0.0.0 (23.1.0.0)**Since:** 2014 
# Syntax
C#  
---  
```text
public void MovePoint(
	XYZ movedPoint,
	XYZ targetPoint
)
```
  
Visual Basic  
---  
```text
Public Sub MovePoint ( _
	movedPoint As XYZ, _
	targetPoint As XYZ _
)
```
  
Visual C++

```text
public:
void MovePoint(
	XYZ^ movedPoint, 
	XYZ^ targetPoint
)
```
  
# ### Parameters
movedPoint
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..XYZ](c2fd995c-95c0-58fb-f5de-f3246cbc5600.md "XYZ Class") The point to be moved. 
targetPoint
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..XYZ](c2fd995c-95c0-58fb-f5de-f3246cbc5600.md "XYZ Class") The new designated location of this point will move to. 
# Remarks
If targetPt exists, the movedPt will be deleted. That means if movedPoint is moved to become a duplicate of an existing point, movedPoint will be deleted instead becuase both points cannot exist at the same location. This applies to a TopographySurface element (not a SiteSubRegion or a topography surface associated with a BuildingPad), which shoule be in an active TopographyEditScope.

Modification cannot be made on this TopographySurface. -or- The input point doesn't exist in the current TopographySurface. |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions..::..ModificationForbiddenException](53205486-5917-7c33-8e67-e362106ddc97.md "ModificationForbiddenException Class") | The document containing this TopographySurface is in failure mode: an operation has failed, and Revit requires the user to either cancel the operation or fix the problem (usually by deleting certain elements). -or- The document containing this TopographySurface is being loaded, or is in the midst of another sensitive process. |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions..::..ModificationOutsideTransactionException](8f025460-c283-ea99-aa8a-5a36e11528f4.md "ModificationOutsideTransactionException Class") | The document containing this TopographySurface has no open transaction. |
