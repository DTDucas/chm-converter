[Transaction Class](308ebf8d-d96d-4643-cd1d-34fffcea53fd.md "Transaction Class") Example See Also

Rolls back all changes made to the model during the transaction.

# ### Parameters
options
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..FailureHandlingOptions](c03bb2e5-f679-bf24-4e87-08b3c3a08385.md "FailureHandlingOptions Class") A set of [options](c03bb2e5-f679-bf24-4e87-08b3c3a08385.md "FailureHandlingOptions Class") to be used for handling eventual failures during this call. 
The options are only used temporarily during this rolling back process. After the transaction is finished, the options will be reset to their default values.
# ### Return Value
If finished successfully, this method returns TransactionStatus.RolledBack. 
Be aware that the returned status does not have to be necessarily the same like the status returned by [GetStatus()()()()](fdf98941-eee4-d8af-e3f7-5b6c7ccc3c74.md "GetStatus Method") even when the method is called immediately after rolling back the transaction. Such difference may happen due to actions made by a transaction finalizer, if there was one set. (See [FailureHandlingOptions](c03bb2e5-f679-bf24-4e87-08b3c3a08385.md "FailureHandlingOptions Class") for more details.)
# Remarks
By rolling back a transaction, all changes made to the model are discarded. RollBack may only be called for a transaction that has been started. (Use the [GetStatus()()()()](fdf98941-eee4-d8af-e3f7-5b6c7ccc3c74.md "GetStatus Method") method to check the current state.) Be aware that rolling back may be delayed (as a result of failure handling.) Callers should always check the returned status to test whether a transaction was rolled back successfully. Only after rolling back is fully completed, the transaction may be started again. 
# Examples
CopyC#
```text
// All and any transaction should be enclosed in a 'using'
// block or guarded within a try-catch-finally blocks
// to guarantee that a transaction does not out-live its scope.
using (Transaction transaction = new Transaction(document))
{
   // Must start the transaction first to be able to modify a document
   transaction.Start("Creating Grid");

   // We create a line and use it as an argument to create a grid
   Line gridLine = Line.CreateBound(new XYZ(0, 0, elevation), new XYZ(20, 0, elevation));

   if ((null != gridLine) && (null != Grid.Create(document, gridLine)))
   {
      if (TransactionStatus.Committed == transaction.Commit())
      {
         return true;
      }
   }

   // We could not create the grid, so we roll the transaction back.

   // To demonstrate one particular property of failure handling options,
   // we can set clearing of accumulated warnings (if any) for this
   // transaction which is about to get rolled back anyway.
   // Clearing warnings is rarely desirable, but sometimes it is convenient.
   FailureHandlingOptions options = transaction.GetFailureHandlingOptions();

   transaction.RollBack(options.SetClearAfterRollback(true));
}
```
