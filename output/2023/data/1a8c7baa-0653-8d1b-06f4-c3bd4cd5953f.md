Alignment..::..GetDistance Method   
[Alignment Class](6594712d-3b22-9b08-ab4c-782df88f36d1.md "Alignment Class") See Also  
---  
Calculates the relative distance along the alignment between two stations based on their alignment distances according to Revit Internal Origin Coordinate Base. The distance may be positive or negative depending on the relative positions of the input stations on the alignment.

# ### Parameters
fromStation
    Type: System..::..DoubleThe displayed alignment station from which 2D length is to be calculated, in Revit internal model units (standard Imperial feet).
toStation
    Type: System..::..DoubleThe displayed alignment station to which 2D length is to be calculated, in Revit internal model units (standard Imperial feet).
# ### Return Value
Distance (positive or negative) along the alignment between two stations. The sign of the distance depends on the relative positions of the input stations on the alignment.
