| --- | --- |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Dispose](7c03212a-b587-1c89-3912-efea0d2619c5.md "Dispose Method") | Causes the object to release immediately any resources it may be utilizing. (Inherited from [APIObject](beb86ef5-39ad-3f0d-0cd9-0c929387a2bb.md "APIObject Class").) |
| [Equals](26d6c913-b5b6-436f-dee9-19ceca7e53c6.md "Equals Method") | Determines whether the specified Object is equal to the current Object.  (Inherited from [GeometryObject](e0f15010-0e19-6216-e2f0-ab7978145daa.md "GeometryObject Class").) |
| [GetDocument](090ee075-cff2-fd8d-5a1a-6c79a7c50a4b.md "GetDocument Method") | Gets the document that contains the symbol of this instance. |
| [GetHashCode](08e8412d-4002-22a5-858d-f55eba1bed34.md "GetHashCode Method") | Gets the integer value of the geometry object as hash code  (Inherited from [GeometryObject](e0f15010-0e19-6216-e2f0-ab7978145daa.md "GeometryObject Class").) |
| [GetInstanceGeometry()()()()](22d4a5d4-dfc2-7227-2cae-b989729696ec.md "GetInstanceGeometry Method") | Computes the geometric representation of the instance. |
| [GetInstanceGeometry(Transform)](d5aad2b5-3211-3800-9f1e-1af921e73902.md "GetInstanceGeometry Method \(Transform\)") | Computes a transformation of the geometric representation of the instance. |
| [GetSymbolGeometry()()()()](7daa0e66-9921-3214-91f4-028e8cfd2618.md "GetSymbolGeometry Method") | Computes the geometric representation of the symbol which generates this instance. |
| [GetSymbolGeometry(Transform)](6de9b5fd-682f-ffa0-5e49-84b1d227d606.md "GetSymbolGeometry Method \(Transform\)") | Computes a transformation of the geometric representation of the symbol which generates this instance. |
| [GetSymbolGeometryId](28708c47-a358-41b3-d754-dda20f01ac6c.md "GetSymbolGeometryId Method") | Gets the SymbolGeometryId that contains data about the symbol of this instance. |
| GetType | Gets the Type of the current instance. (Inherited from Object.) |
| ToString | Returns a string that represents the current object. (Inherited from Object.) |
