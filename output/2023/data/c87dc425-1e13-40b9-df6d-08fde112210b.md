# Members
| Member name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| --- | --- |
| Success | A valid path of travel between the two points was found. Use [!:Autodesk::Revit::DB::Analysis::PathOfTravel::GetCurveLoop] to retrieve the calculated points of path of travel. |
| NoPathOfTravel | There is no valid path between the two points. |
| AreaTooLarge | The view outline is too large. Calculation of the path of travel cannot be performed. |
| SplitView | The view is split. Calculation of the path of travel cannot be performed. |
| ResultAffectedByCrop | The view has an active crop region set. If [!:Autodesk::Revit::DB::Analysis::PathOfTravel::GetCurveLoop] contains no points, no path of travel was found inside the crop region, but a valid path may exist outside of it. If [!:Autodesk::Revit::DB::Analysis::PathOfTravel::GetCurveLoop] contains valid points, a path of travel was found inside the crop region, but a better option may exist outside of it. |
| StartAndEndPointsTooClose | Distance between adjacent points of path of travel (start, end and way points) is less than the value of [!:Autodesk::Revit::DB::Analysis::RouteAnalysisSettings::MinimumLength]. |
| PointOutsideActiveCrop | Start or end point is outside the active view crop. |
| TooMuchGeometry | The view is exporting too much geometry. Calculation of the path of travel cannot be performed. |
| RevealObstaclesModeFailureDataExist | Reveal Obstacles mode cannot be set for the view because analysis data exist in the view. |
| RevealObstaclesModeFailureWireframe | Reveal Obstacles mode cannot be set for the view because wireframe display style is set for the view. |
| TemporaryModeFailureDataExist | Temporary mode cannot be set for the view because analysis data exist in the view. |
| TemporaryModeFailureWireframe | Temporary mode cannot be set for the view because wireframe display style is set for the view. |
