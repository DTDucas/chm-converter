Creates a Surface object coincident with the surface of revolution defined by an axis, a profile curve, and start and end angles of revolution.

# ### Parameters
axisBasePoint
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..XYZ](c2fd995c-95c0-58fb-f5de-f3246cbc5600.md "XYZ Class") The base point of the axis of revolution. Expected to lie within the Revit design limits [IsWithinLengthLimits(XYZ)](ac2171af-4250-8a30-faa7-4d7030d29a03.md "IsWithinLengthLimits Method"). 
axisDirection
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..XYZ](c2fd995c-95c0-58fb-f5de-f3246cbc5600.md "XYZ Class") The direction of the axis. 
profileCurve
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..Curve](400cc9b6-9ff7-de85-6fd8-c20002209d25.md "Curve Class") The profile curve, which should satisfy the following conditions: 
  * It is bounded and non-degenerate. 
  * It is co-planar with the axis of revolution. 
  * It lies on only one side of the axis. 
  * Only the end points of the profile curve can touch the axis. 

startAngle
    Type: System..::..Double Start angle of rotation. The angles are measured around the axis of revolution, using the right-hand rule. The profile curve is at the zero angle. 
endAngle
    Type: System..::..Double End angle of rotation. Start angle must be less than end angle and their difference must be less than or equal to two times PI. 
# ### Return Value
The created surface. Note that this surface may not be of type RevolvedSurface. 
# Remarks
The returned surface may not be of type RevolvedSurface - this function will create a surface of the simplest possible type (Plane, Cylinder, etc.) that can be used to represent the required surface of revolution. Given that the surface may be simplified, this function does not guarantee any particular parameterization of the surface. 
# Exceptions
| Exception | Condition |
| --- | --- |
| --- | --- |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions..::..ArgumentException](2e6e4206-97a8-dd4b-df5d-4269f4bb6088.md "ArgumentException Class") | The input point lies outside of Revit design limits. -or- The input profile curve is not valid to create a surface revolution around the given axis. |

| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions..::..ArgumentOutOfRangeException](60f148c9-ece0-a6bb-4e12-bb4a9c8c8a24.md "ArgumentOutOfRangeException Class") | axisDirection has zero length. |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions..::..ArgumentsInconsistentException](05972c68-fa6d-3a83-d720-ad84fbc4780f.md "ArgumentsInconsistentException Class") | Start angle must be less than end angle and their difference must be less than or equal to two times PI. |
