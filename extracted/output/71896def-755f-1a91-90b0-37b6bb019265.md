# Remarks

Any change to an IFC file can only be made while there is an active transaction open for that file. Changes do not become a part of the file until the active transaction is [committed](f6b01516-d3a8-8177-a605-cc14911b7a59.md). Consequently, all changes made in a transaction can be [rolled back](ea79ab12-ca64-4dfc-e71a-93298c207056.md) either explicitly or implicitly (by the destructor).
