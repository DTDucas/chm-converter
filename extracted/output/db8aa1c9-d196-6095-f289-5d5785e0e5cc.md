# Exceptions

| Exception | Condition |
| --- | --- |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions..::..ArgumentException](2e6e4206-97a8-dd4b-df5d-4269f4bb6088.md) | The input curve loops cannot compose a valid boundary, that means: no curve loop is contained in the given collection; these curve loops intersect with each other for some of them; or each curve loop is not closed individually; or each curve loop is not planar; or each curve loop is not in a plane parallel to the horizontal(XY) plane. |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions..::..ArgumentNullException](631e1424-60f4-929b-4e52-dda9dcd26316.md) | A non-optional argument was null |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions..::..InvalidOperationException](9e715f03-3884-e539-4dd6-8d7545733adc.md) | Failed to create the Sketch for the boundary of current BuildingPad. -or- Cannot find an appropriate hosting topography surface for this BuildingPad. -or- This topography surface cannot be the host of this BuildingPad. -or- The given curve loops intersect with curve loops of existing BuildingPads hosted on the same TopographySurface. -or- There is at least one existing SubRegion which is completely inside or overlap the boundary of current BuildingPad hosted on the same TopographySurface. This behavior is not allowed. |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions..::..ModificationForbiddenException](53205486-5917-7c33-8e67-e362106ddc97.md) | The document containing this BuildingPad is in failure mode: an operation has failed, and Revit requires the user to either cancel the operation or fix the problem (usually by deleting certain elements). -or- The document containing this BuildingPad is being loaded, or is in the midst of another |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions..::..ModificationOutsideTransactionException](8f025460-c283-ea99-aa8a-5a36e11528f4.md) | The document containing this BuildingPad has no open transaction. |
