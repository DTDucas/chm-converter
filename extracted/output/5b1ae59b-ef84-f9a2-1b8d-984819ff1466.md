# Properties

|  | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | [FarDistance](16edd64f-ac8d-23aa-dfc7-514e4bebcd13.md) | Distance from eye point to far plane of view frustum along the view direction. |
|  | [HorizontalExtent](8247b292-f93f-684f-8270-a7c2fa92a6c8.md) | Distance between left and right planes on the target plane. |
|  | [IsPerspective](37b664d0-d6fe-63b8-97f3-d23f3ec7c237.md) | Identifies whether the projection is orthographic or perspective |
|  | [IsPespective](e5b44850-c499-942a-b1b1-1cbf145e1417.md) | Identifies whether the projection is orthographic or perspective |
