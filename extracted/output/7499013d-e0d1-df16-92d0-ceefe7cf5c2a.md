#### Parameters

origin
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..XYZ](c2fd995c-95c0-58fb-f5de-f3246cbc5600.md)The origin of family instance. If created on a [ViewPlan](0520580a-74ec-ed8c-35ea-5274c42276a3.md), the origin will be projected onto the [ViewPlan](0520580a-74ec-ed8c-35ea-5274c42276a3.md). 

symbol
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..FamilySymbol](a1acaed0-6a62-4c1d-94f5-4e27ce0923d3.md)A family symbol object that represents the type of the instance that is to be inserted.

specView
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..View](fb92a4e7-f3a7-ef14-e631-342179b18de9.md)The 2D view in which to place the family instance.

#### Return Value

If creation was successful then an instance to the new object is returned.

# Remarks

This overload applies only to 2D family symbols (detail components, annotation symbols, titleblocks, etc.). The type/symbol that is used must be loaded into the document before this method is called. Families and their symbols can be loaded using the Document.LoadFamily or Document.LoadFamilySymbol methods.
