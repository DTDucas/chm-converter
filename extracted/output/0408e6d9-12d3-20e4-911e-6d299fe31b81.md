# Remarks

This is a base class from which SingleServerService and MultiServerService classes are inherited. It implements all basic methods, but the two inherited classes add more methods specific for that kind of service the class represents. Use this base class to get information about a service and its servers. Use the specific inherited classes to set or get active servers. 

Summary of common methods: 

  * Adding and removing a server to and from a service
  * Getting information about a service
  * Querying a number of servers registered for a service
  * Accessing servers currently registered for a service

Summary of the service-specific methods: 
  * Getting and setting active server (or servers) for a service
