NurbsSurfaceData..::..Create Method   
[NurbsSurfaceData Class](7d65dbde-8aac-7d7d-e811-a6c91a541de4.md "NurbsSurfaceData Class") See Also  
---  
Construct NurbsSurfaceData based on NURBS surface data, where the weights are supplied. The NURBS surface will be (piecewise) polynomial if all the weights are equal, rational if not. Note: A rational polynomial is a quotient of two polynomials; this includes a polynomial, which can be thought of as a quotient with denominator equal to 1.

# ### Parameters
degreeU
    Type: System..::..Int32 The degree of the spline in the u-direction; must be positive. 
degreeV
    Type: System..::..Int32 The degree of the spline in the v-direction; must be positive. 
knotsU
    Type: System.Collections.Generic..::..IList<(Of <(<'Double>)>)> Knot values in the u-direction. The number of knots in the u-direction must be at least 2 * (degreeU + 1). 
knotsV
    Type: System.Collections.Generic..::..IList<(Of <(<'Double>)>)> Knot values in the v-direction. The number of knots in the v-direction must be at least 2 * (degreeV + 1). 
controlPoints
    Type: System.Collections.Generic..::..IList<(Of <(<'[XYZ](c2fd995c-95c0-58fb-f5de-f3246cbc5600.md "XYZ Class")>)>)> One dimensional array of points representing the two dimensional net of control points of the NURBS surface in u and v directions. 
The total number of control points must equal numControlPtsU times numControlPtsV, where numControlPtsU and numControlPtsV are the numbers of control points in u and v directions, and they must satisfy the following conditions: 
  * numControlPtsU = number of knots in u - degreeU - 1. 
  * numControlPtsV = number of knots in v - degreeV - 1. 

The convention for 2d (idxU, idxV) to 1d (idx) conversion of array indexes: idxV first. That is, idxU is outer loop and idxV is inner loop. In other words, idx = idxU * numControlPtsV + idxV. 
weights
    Type: System.Collections.Generic..::..IList<(Of <(<'Double>)>)> Array of weights assigned to the control points. The number of weights must equal the number of control points. All weights should be greater than zero. 
bReverseOrientation
    Type: System..::..Boolean If true, the surface's orientation is opposite to the canonical parametric orientation, otherwise it is the same. The canonical parametric orientation is a counter-clockwise sense of rotation in the uv-parameter plane. Extrinsically, the oriented normal vector for the canonical parametric orientation points in the direction of the cross product dS/du x dS/dv, which S(u, v) is the parameterized surface.
