# Syntax

C#

    public double Angle { get; set; }  
  
Visual Basic  
---  
      
    
    Public Property Angle As Double
    	Get
    	Set  
  
Visual C++  
---  
      
    
    public:
    property double Angle {
    	double get ();
    	void set (double value);
    }  
  
# Remarks

Angle may be assigned for connectors of some family instances. In order to set this property, it must be mapped to a writable instance parameter in the family definition. For a connector obtained from a non-family instance (for example not a fitting, but instead a pipe, duct, or cable tray), the value will always be zero. Non-zero angles are only valid for family instance fitting connectors.
