A ruled surface is created by sweeping a line between two profile curves or between a curve and a point (a point and a curve). Input curve(s) must be bounded or have natural bounds.

# Remarks

Both curves are evaluated in normalized parameters [0, 1] The parametric equations of a ruled surface are: Curve C1 and curve C2 : S(u, v) = C1(u) + v * (C2(u) - C1(u)); Point P1 and curve C2 : S(u, v) = P1 + v * (C2(u) - P1); Curve C1 and point P2 : S(u, v) = C1(u) + v * (P2 - C1(u)); The point/point case is not allowed as that would define a degenerate ruled surface.
