# Methods

|  | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | Equals | Determines whether the specified Object is equal to the current Object. (Inherited from Object.) |

|  | [GetLibraryPaths](c73eca5e-72d7-b75b-d47e-7ea2565b3920.md) | Returns path information identifying where Revit searches for content. |
|  | GetType | Gets the Type of the current instance. (Inherited from Object.) |
