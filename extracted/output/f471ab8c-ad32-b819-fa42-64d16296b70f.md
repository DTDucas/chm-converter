The [AreaBasedLoadData](10433e6e-e655-db35-54a9-cc8034cff631.md "AreaBasedLoadData Class") type exposes the following members.
# Methods
| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [AddElectricalLoadArea](16569cca-cbd2-40f8-6323-810037f1111b.md "AddElectricalLoadArea Method") | Adds electrical load area into the area based load. |
| [CanConnectToUpstreamNode](6e1ab074-f31d-5780-6b6e-bacfe8a5a1c5.md "CanConnectToUpstreamNode Method") | Verifies that the area based load can connect to the upstream electrical analytical node. If the area based load already has an upstream node or the upstream node is full of downstream nodes, the area based load can't connect to the upstream node. |
| [CanDisconnectFromUpstreamNode](5bdfacad-3210-89cc-2ea6-5e7c8412c08b.md "CanDisconnectFromUpstreamNode Method") | Verifies that the area based load can disconnect from the upstream electrical analytical node. If the area based load hasn't an upstream node, it can't disconnect from the upstream node. |
| [ConnectToUpstreamNode](16a78358-8e4a-3150-5574-3ed21f3a64b4.md "ConnectToUpstreamNode Method") | Connects to an upstream electrical analytical node. |
| [DisconnectFromUpstreamNode](8d862062-1657-5ba3-b610-365d7a0b0d83.md "DisconnectFromUpstreamNode Method") | Disconnects from an upstream electrical analytical node. |
| [Dispose](0d957f82-66da-1ecb-c9e3-7269268f3a2d.md "Dispose Method") | (Inherited from [ZoneElementDomainData](4fd427fa-088d-0fd9-4046-2f8f82f8b1e2.md "ZoneElementDomainData Class").) |
| Equals | Determines whether the specified Object is equal to the current Object. (Inherited from Object.) |
| [GetElectricalLoadAreas](05745395-b4f0-44ec-8732-93a4147b60b0.md "GetElectricalLoadAreas Method") | Gets electrical load areas which the area based load includes. |
| GetHashCode | Serves as a hash function for a particular type.  (Inherited from Object.) |
| GetType | Gets the Type of the current instance. (Inherited from Object.) |
| [GetUpstreamNodeId](36df9aff-cc37-9dff-85d0-15f265198a76.md "GetUpstreamNodeId Method") | Gets the upstream electrical analytical node id. |
| [RemoveElectricalLoadArea](826066f6-c600-9c31-ab8a-340f1f02b8ae.md "RemoveElectricalLoadArea Method") | Removes electrical load area from the area based load. |
| ToString | Returns a string that represents the current object. (Inherited from Object.) |
