BoundingBoxIntersectsFilter Class  
[Members](7ef1b6ab-3aaa-3ac3-34c3-81d7b44534be.md "BoundingBoxIntersectsFilter Members") Example See Also  
---  
A filter used to match elements with a bounding box that intersects the given Outline. 
**Namespace:** [Autodesk.Revit.DB](87546ba7-461b-c646-cbb1-2cb8f5bff8b2.md "Autodesk.Revit.DB Namespace")**Assembly:** RevitAPI (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 24.0.0.0 (24.0.0.0)**Since:** 2011 
# Syntax

public class BoundingBoxIntersectsFilter : ElementQuickFilter

public ref class BoundingBoxIntersectsFilter : public ElementQuickFilter

# Remarks
This filter excludes all objects derived from View and objects derived from ElementType. This filter is a quick filter. Quick filters operate only on the ElementRecord, a low-memory class which has a limited interface to read element properties. Elements which are rejected by a quick filter will not be expanded in memory. 
# Examples
CopyC#
```text
// Use BoundingBoxIntersects filter to find elements with a bounding box that intersects the 
// given Outline in the document. 

// Create a Outline, uses a minimum and maximum XYZ point to initialize the outline. 
Outline myOutLn = new Outline(new XYZ(0, 0, 0), new XYZ(100, 100, 100));

// Create a BoundingBoxIntersects filter with this Outline
BoundingBoxIntersectsFilter filter = new BoundingBoxIntersectsFilter(myOutLn);

// Apply the filter to the elements in the active document
// This filter excludes all objects derived from View and objects derived from ElementType
FilteredElementCollector collector = new FilteredElementCollector(document);
IList<Element> elements = collector.WherePasses(filter).ToElements();

// Find all walls which don't intersect with BoundingBox: use an inverted filter to match elements
// Use shortcut command OfClass() to find walls only
BoundingBoxIntersectsFilter invertFilter = new BoundingBoxIntersectsFilter(myOutLn, true); // inverted filter
collector = new FilteredElementCollector(document);
IList<Element> notIntersectWalls =
    collector.OfClass(typeof(Wall)).WherePasses(invertFilter).ToElements();
```
