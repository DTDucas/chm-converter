# Remarks

This filter excludes all objects derived from View and objects derived from ElementType. This filter is a quick filter. Quick filters operate only on the ElementRecord, a low-memory class which has a limited interface to read element properties. Elements which are rejected by a quick filter will not be expanded in memory. 

# Examples

CopyC#
    
    
    // Use BoundingBoxIntersects filter to find elements with a bounding box that intersects the 
    // given Outline in the document. 
    
    // Create a Outline, uses a minimum and maximum XYZ point to initialize the outline. 
    Outline myOutLn = new Outline(new XYZ(0, 0, 0), new XYZ(100, 100, 100));
    
    // Create a BoundingBoxIntersects filter with this Outline
    BoundingBoxIntersectsFilter filter = new BoundingBoxIntersectsFilter(myOutLn);
    
    // Apply the filter to the elements in the active document
    // This filter excludes all objects derived from View and objects derived from ElementType
    FilteredElementCollector collector = new FilteredElementCollector(document);
    IList<Element> elements = collector.WherePasses(filter).ToElements();
    
    
    // Find all walls which don't intersect with BoundingBox: use an inverted filter to match elements
    // Use shortcut command OfClass() to find walls only
    BoundingBoxIntersectsFilter invertFilter = new BoundingBoxIntersectsFilter(myOutLn, true); // inverted filter
    collector = new FilteredElementCollector(document);
    IList<Element> notIntersectWalls =
        collector.OfClass(typeof(Wall)).WherePasses(invertFilter).ToElements();
