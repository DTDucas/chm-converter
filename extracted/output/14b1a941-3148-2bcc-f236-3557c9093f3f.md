The [RebarTrimExtendData](980b816d-dc7e-7550-3e37-61482516b5ab.md) type exposes the following members.

# Methods

|  | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | [AddBarGeometry(IList<(Of <<'(Curve>)>>))](674f12da-e4a0-fc7f-b011-a706c7859d40.md) | Adds a new rebar geometry. This information is set to the rebar after the API execution is finished successfully. |
|  | [AddBarGeometry(CurveLoop)](9948f497-0cdc-b3b6-a465-b7fe4e843da2.md) | Adds a new rebar geometry. This information is set to the rebar after the API execution is finished successfully. |
|  | [CanAddBarGeometry](4dc39ffe-585f-9f4f-725c-5269d71bfc1e.md) | Returns true if getNumberOfBarGeometry() is less than GetNumberOfBars(), false otherwise. |
|  | [ClearAllAddedBarGeometry](f1450c93-30ed-79cf-0acd-3619cb170428.md) | This function will remove all bars geometry that were added by calling AddBarGeometry(). |
|  | [CreateEndConstraint](30f97bb3-ad2e-6240-6222-afa70754f1f3.md) | Creates a constraint for the end handle of the rebar. This constraint will be set preferred after the API execution is finished successfully. |
|  | [CreateStartConstraint](d4a71afa-9ebd-fc3d-6b74-79180843f086.md) | Creates a constraint for the start handle of the rebar. This constraint will be set preferred after the API execution is finished successfully. |
|  | [Dispose](030e9c7c-7be8-8554-751e-9cffc4264b8b.md) |  |
|  | Equals | Determines whether the specified Object is equal to the current Object. (Inherited from Object.) |
|  | [GetAddedBarGeometry](64c06ae1-86b7-4e86-94df-2a6d99084a11.md) | Gets the added curves that will represent the bar at index barIndex. |
|  | GetHashCode | Serves as a hash function for a particular type.  (Inherited from Object.) |
|  | [GetNumberOfBarGeometry](58c19b83-13ae-de95-4950-aefa2873f687.md) | Gets the number of Bar Geometry that were added. |
|  | [GetRebarUpdateCurvesData](64b5059a-5cfe-bf9a-b13c-dea51ff40449.md) | Gets a class that contains information used as input and output for rebar free form calculation. |
|  | GetType | Gets the Type of the current instance. (Inherited from Object.) |
|  | ToString | Returns a string that represents the current object. (Inherited from Object.) |
