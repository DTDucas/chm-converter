# Remarks

So far, only bitmap file is supported for [ImagePath](35ae5240-5ed5-909b-9e89-3bd17eff90fd.md). The rendered image is the same size in pixel dimensions as the original one. To get a better result, the caller should prepare the image with proper size, for exmaple: 32x32 or 64x64 in pixels, before use. To achive a "transparent" backgound color effect over the provided bitmap, the bitmap should use color RGB(0, 128, 128) as its background and it will be cleared during rendering by Revit.
