#### Parameters

#### Return Value

The elements and worksets that were relinquished. 

# Remarks

Elements and worksets owned by other users are ignored. 

Only unmodified elements already in central will be relinquished by this method. Newly added and modified elements cannot be relinquished until they have been synchronized with central. 

For best performance, relinquish items in one big call, rather than many small calls.
