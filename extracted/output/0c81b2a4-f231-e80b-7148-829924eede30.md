| [CurveRoofSkippedLoopsError](7afc334d-334d-1969-6db8-7a6a83a14947.md "CurveRoofSkippedLoopsError Property") | Some loops were skipped |
| [CurveRoofSkippedLoopsWarn](bfc94904-f852-cafd-68dd-7a04c2337204.md "CurveRoofSkippedLoopsWarn Property") | Some loops were skipped |
| [ExtrudedRoofCutBySketch](b5793502-a8c3-298c-1b41-7c80ed213cf3.md "ExtrudedRoofCutBySketch Property") | Entire extruded Roof is cut by cut Sketch. |
| [HadToAlignEaves](22f5fae5-1688-fb44-ef5e-8d4eed1f0fd3.md "HadToAlignEaves Property") | Adjacent slope-defining lines must have identical eave heights. Eaves were aligned to higher location automatically to avoid failure. Use the Align Eaves tool to specify desired location. |
| [HoleInRoofFailed](94c9ec8a-0b02-8add-5612-9e027b48d355.md "HoleInRoofFailed Property") | Hole(s) could not be cut in roof. |
| [InvalidArcSegmentation](771039ef-e02f-79a5-be21-c68c26ef38f5.md "InvalidArcSegmentation Property") | A segmented slope-defining arc has too few segments. |
| [JoinedRoofMissesTarget](8f54628a-2f57-361b-3428-91fd6ddf7f8d.md "JoinedRoofMissesTarget Property") | Part of the roof to be joined misses the target face. |
| [JoinedRoofMissesTargetError](d909f8d2-33e0-6a5c-2ee3-f1d8044db819.md "JoinedRoofMissesTargetError Property") | Part of the roof to be joined misses the target face. |
| [NoFlatCurtainRoofs](e402ca4f-d3c9-dbca-5cf7-c85d12ab6061.md "NoFlatCurtainRoofs Property") | A Sloped Glazing with no slope is not allowed. |
| [OnlyOneSlopeCurtainRoof](c1d9a99c-0953-bfca-88ea-f57e9623f824.md "OnlyOneSlopeCurtainRoof Property") | Only one slope in curtain roof. |
| [OnlyUpwardFacesUsed](12fee65b-1d68-8c15-4a41-a83137a545e7.md "OnlyUpwardFacesUsed Property") | The selected faces contain both upward and downward pointing faces. Only the upward pointing faces were used. |
| [RoofCutoffRemoved](4098ccb1-8319-2ca9-ce95-923220efa736.md "RoofCutoffRemoved Property") | The roof's cutoff failed and was removed; make sure the cutoff height is not below the roof. |
| [RoofExceedsMaxHeight](7d921641-763b-6e3b-3063-fffe91023797.md "RoofExceedsMaxHeight Property") | Roof exceeds user-specified maximum height |
| [RoofMeetsRoofTangentially](8f3fcaa2-0376-86ae-234b-5a052fc629b9.md "RoofMeetsRoofTangentially Property") | The roofs cannot be joined because the roof being joined meets the target roof tangentially. |
| [RoofMeetsRoofTangentiallyError](0d627ee2-ee2a-199d-90c9-dc0afca3bf94.md "RoofMeetsRoofTangentiallyError Property") | The roofs cannot be joined because the roof being joined meets the target roof tangentially. |
| [RoofSlopeExceedsThreshold](d6549811-2c3b-c8da-a7f5-5fd4ef21d012.md "RoofSlopeExceedsThreshold Property") | Thickness of this Roof may be slightly inaccurate due to extreme Shape Editing. Dimensions to this element in sections and details may not accurately indicate the Thickness shown in Type Properties. |
| [RoofToRefPlanes](6e2ffbde-bf0b-67fe-9208-eb771a06d155.md "RoofToRefPlanes Property") | Roof cannot be joined to more than one reference plane. |
| [RoofToRefPlanesError](e602ac7a-bc1b-53ab-de94-99e9840300c5.md "RoofToRefPlanesError Property") | Roof cannot be joined to more than one reference plane. |
| [UnusedSlopeArrow](a5a61aea-455f-eb3d-bdea-4eb76ccf3f12.md "UnusedSlopeArrow Property") | The tails of all slope arrows must lie on the roof boundary. |
| [UptoHeightTooLow](6dda3c9b-ec2f-5a41-4aca-43288dce2f33.md "UptoHeightTooLow Property") | Cutoff Level cannot be below bottom of roof. |
