# Members

| Member name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Top | Vertically, on top of physical model. |
| Center | Vertically, center of physical model. |
| Bottom | Vertically, bottom of physical model. |
| SideOne | Horizontally, corresponds to first side (e.g., interior). |
| SideTwo | Horizontally, corresponds to second side (e.g., exterior). |
| AutoDetect | Auto-detect projections for analytical model. |
| Invalid | Set to a bad setting. Should only be set at this very rarely (i.e., at initial creation). |
| SketchCurve | For sketch-based analytical models. |
| DatumPlane | Use a Datum Plane for projection (e.g., Grid, Level). |
| NotApplicable | None of the other projection types apply. |
| Default | Element-specific default value. |
| CenterOfCore | Center of wall core. |
| LocationLine | Location Line. |
| Varies | Projection types are different at each end. |
