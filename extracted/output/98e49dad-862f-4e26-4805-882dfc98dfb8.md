# Remarks

This id can be passed to obtain the element from Document.Element[string] property, but any link obtained through this method may no longer be a valid or up-to-date link. The originating CAD link is only accurate and up-to-date at the time of creation of the energy model. An empty string is returned if the originating CAD object is not hosted in a linked document.
