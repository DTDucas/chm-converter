# Constructors

|  | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | [Frame()()()()](c7377867-7820-d794-dc11-83dae15a3a19.md) | Default constructor. Uses global origin and standard basis vectors. |
|  | [Frame(XYZ, XYZ, XYZ, XYZ)](54dba681-7199-f73f-2908-9bbe54689f6d.md) | Constructor that takes the frame's base point and three basis vectors. |
  
# Methods

|  | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | [CanDefineRevitGeometry](49a621dd-b76c-d0b2-7850-a846a14edbfe.md) | Tests whether the supplied Frame object may be used to define a Revit curve or surface. In order to satisfy the requirements the Frame must be orthonormal and its origin is expected to lie within the Revit design limits [IsWithinLengthLimits(XYZ)](ac2171af-4250-8a30-faa7-4d7030d29a03.md). |
|  | [Dispose](01664e31-f00c-d00b-4b5a-ae563a69e73b.md) | Releases all resources used by the [Frame](d44b3fd1-34d0-bfd0-55f6-de24235edf2e.md) |
|  | Equals | Determines whether the specified Object is equal to the current Object. (Inherited from Object.) |
|  | GetHashCode | Serves as a hash function for a particular type.  (Inherited from Object.) |
|  | GetType | Gets the Type of the current instance. (Inherited from Object.) |
|  | [IsOrthogonal](50351f59-56cc-0e6a-9db6-02b6b5cb0f21.md) | Determines if this frame's basis vectors are orthogonal. |
|  | [IsOrthonormal](8ef3b2a0-119d-12c1-9e13-a3a878e76580.md) | Determines if this frame's basis vectors are orthonormal. |
|  | [IsRightHanded](9a9727f4-270c-f6b0-60ce-482889e15213.md) | Determine if this frame's basis is right-handed. |
|  | ToString | Returns a string that represents the current object. (Inherited from Object.) |
|  | [Transform](50ef89f7-1c5b-46ad-a33d-911b6834f8e6.md) | Applies the input transform to this frame. |
  
# Properties

|  | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | [BasisX](b28df9ee-1363-aa44-8a8f-db0c631dd797.md) | The first basis vector of the frame. |
|  | [BasisY](129f694e-8943-2999-3d2f-25d19a3bb9f2.md) | The second basis vector of the frame. |
|  | [BasisZ](b0d0e152-5f46-cbb0-bf2c-8f90b4ef59ee.md) | The third basis vector of the frame. |
|  | [IsValidObject](46ce3715-590e-d9b3-4ad0-a3e739961a66.md) | Specifies whether the .NET object represents a valid Revit entity. |
|  | [Origin](7899dacb-82bb-f1a6-b2fb-786aa2792f6f.md) | The frame's base point. |
