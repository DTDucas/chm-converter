# Remarks

A copy of the compound structure is returned and changes made to it will not apply to the type until SetCompoundStructure is called. From this object the layers of a compound structure can be accessed. If the element does not have a compound structure then this method will return nullNothingnullptra null reference (Nothing in Visual Basic).
