# Syntax

C#  
---  
      
    
    public void Regenerate()  
  
Visual Basic  
---  
      
    
    Public Sub Regenerate  
  
Visual C++  
---  
      
    
    public:
    void Regenerate()  
  
# Remarks

Use this method to force update to the document after a group of changes. Note that when a transaction is committed there is an automatic call to regenerate the document.

# Examples

CopyC#
    
    
    FamilyInstance instance = doc.Create.NewFamilyInstance(new XYZ(15, 20, 0), familySymbol, StructuralType.NonStructural);
    FamilyInstance instance2 = doc.Create.NewFamilyInstance(new XYZ(25, 30, 0), familySymbol, StructuralType.NonStructural);
    // faster to create multiple instances without calling Regenerate after each one
    
    LocationPoint point = instance.Location as LocationPoint;
    // this data is incorrect because the new geometry has not yet been regenerated
    
    doc.Regenerate();
    point = instance.Location as LocationPoint;
    // now it is correct

CopyVB.NET
    
    
    Dim instance As FamilyInstance = doc.Create.NewFamilyInstance(New XYZ(15, 20, 0), familySymbol, StructuralType.NonStructural)
    Dim instance2 As FamilyInstance = doc.Create.NewFamilyInstance(New XYZ(25, 30, 0), familySymbol, StructuralType.NonStructural)
    ' faster to create multiple instances without calling Regenerate after each one
    
    
    Dim point As LocationPoint = TryCast(instance.Location, LocationPoint)
    ' this data is incorrect because the new geometry has not yet been regenerated
    
    
    doc.Regenerate()
    point = TryCast(instance.Location, LocationPoint)
    ' now it is correct

# Exceptions

| Exception | Condition |
| --- | --- |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions..::..RegenerationFailedException](787bb389-74c2-5ce7-cdd6-32211209ded2.md) | Thrown when the operation fails. |

  * If regeneration fails, there is posted error of severity DocumentCorruption that will be delivered to the end user at the end of transaction explaining what specifically has happened. 
  * If regeneration has failed, document is corrupted and even reading from it is illegal.
  * Code that called regeneration and got this exception should not catch and ignore it - instead, it should do nothing but internal cleanup and return control to the owner of currently active transaction/subtransaction, which must be aborted.

  
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions..::..InvalidOperationException](9e715f03-3884-e539-4dd6-8d7545733adc.md) | Modification of the document is forbidden. Typically, this is because there is no open transaction; consult documentation for Document.IsModified for other possible causes. |
