The ElementId of the AppearanceAssetElement. 
**Namespace:** [Autodesk.Revit.DB](87546ba7-461b-c646-cbb1-2cb8f5bff8b2.md "Autodesk.Revit.DB Namespace")**Assembly:** RevitAPI (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 24.0.0.0 (24.0.0.0)**Since:** 2014 
# Syntax
C#  
---  
```text
public ElementId AppearanceAssetId { get; set; }
```
  
Visual Basic  
---  
```text
Public Property AppearanceAssetId As ElementId
	Get
	Set
```
  
Visual C++  
---  
```text
public:
property ElementId^ AppearanceAssetId {
	ElementId^ get ();
	void set (ElementId^ value);
}
```
  
# ### Field Value
The id of the AppearanceAssetElement, or InvalidElementId if the material does not have an associated appearance asset. 
# Remarks
This is the id to the element that contains visual material information used for rendering. In some cases where the material is created without setting up custom render appearance properties (for example, when the material is created via an import, or when it is created by the API), this property will be InvalidElementId. In that situation the standard material properties such as [Color](0c6c0bd9-15db-d839-786d-b33d18311017.md "Color Property") and [Transparency](71499d4f-686b-c708-fd87-a3f6523b3189.md "Transparency Property") will dictate the appearance of the material during rendering. 
# Examples

```text
private void ReadMaterialAppearanceProp(Document document, Material material)
{
   ElementId appearanceId = material.AppearanceAssetId;
   AppearanceAssetElement appearanceElem = document.GetElement(appearanceId) as AppearanceAssetElement;
   Asset theAsset = appearanceElem.GetRenderingAsset();
   string libraryName = theAsset.LibraryName;
   string title = theAsset.Title;

   // The predefined asset can be empty. at this time, get the system appearance asset instead.
   if (theAsset.Size == 0)
   {
      IList<Asset> systemAppearanceAssets = document.Application.GetAssets(AssetType.Appearance);
      foreach (Asset systemAsset in systemAppearanceAssets)

            && theAsset.Name == systemAsset.Name)

            // Read the Asset information here.

         }
