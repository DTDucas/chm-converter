| [CutWithHalfSpace](cbde1739-3680-4f2a-8215-a48fd08dcb5c.md "CutWithHalfSpace Method") | Creates a new Solid which is the intersection of the input Solid with the half-space on the positive side of the given Plane. The positive side of the plane is the side to which Plane.Normal points. |
| [CutWithHalfSpaceModifyingOriginalSolid](ba309158-59c7-465a-1d50-985cf74b3918.md "CutWithHalfSpaceModifyingOriginalSolid Method") | Modifies the input Solid preserving only the volume on the positive side of the given Plane. The positive side of the plane is the side to which Plane.Normal points. |
| [Dispose](6fa59aa5-9b3b-7e5d-338b-8dbbb8847e4a.md "Dispose Method") |
| Equals | Determines whether the specified Object is equal to the current Object. (Inherited from Object.) |
| [ExecuteBooleanOperation](89cb7975-cc76-65ba-b996-bcb78d12161a.md "ExecuteBooleanOperation Method") | Perform a boolean geometric operation between two solids, and return a new solid to represent the result. |
| [ExecuteBooleanOperationModifyingOriginalSolid](17966565-84c8-9dc3-dc0d-62cb6c896624.md "ExecuteBooleanOperationModifyingOriginalSolid Method") | Perform a boolean geometric operation between two solids, and modify the original solid to represent the result. |
| GetHashCode | Serves as a hash function for a particular type.  (Inherited from Object.) |
