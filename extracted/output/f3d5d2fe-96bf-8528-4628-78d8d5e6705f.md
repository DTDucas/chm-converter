# ### Field Value
This value may be if the object does not store a corresponding reference. This might be due to any of the following reasons: 
  * The face was obtained from an API member which does not permit options to generate corresponding References (most API members, besides Element.Geometry, do not have an option to generate a Reference). 
  * The corresponding geometry object does not permit referencing.
