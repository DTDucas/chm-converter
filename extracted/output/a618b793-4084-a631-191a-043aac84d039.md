# Remarks

This is the base class for duct and pipe section. This class is mainly for pressure loss calculation. It is a series of connected elements (segments - ducts or pipes, fittings, terminals and accessories). All section members should have same flow analysis properties: Flow, Size, Velocity, Friction and Roughness. One section member element which contains more than one connector can belongs to multiple section. e.g.: One Tee which has 3 connectors, usually, it belongs 3 sections. One segment which connect to a tap will be divided into 2 sections.
