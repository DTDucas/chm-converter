#### Parameters

otherOutline
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..Outline](1ffe9215-0dd5-358f-495d-e983f9e7d295.md) The outline to test for containment. 

tolerance
    Type: System..::..Double The tolerance to use when determining whether the point is contained. Defaults to zero. 

#### Return Value

True if this outline contains the given outline, or false otherwise. 

# Remarks

If the tolerance is positive, the other Outline may extend the tolerance distance outside of this Outline in each coordinate. If the tolerance is negative, the other Outline must lie at least the tolerance distance inside of this Outline in each coordinate to be a match.
