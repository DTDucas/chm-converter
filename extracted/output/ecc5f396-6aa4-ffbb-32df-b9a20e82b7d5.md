# ### Parameters
linkInstanceId
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..ElementId](44f3f7b1-3229-3404-93c9-dc5e70337dd6.md "ElementId Class") The ElementId of the link instance (such as RevitLinkInstance or ImportInstance) from which the coordinates would be acquired. 
# Remarks
When you acquire coordinates from the linked model, the shared coordinates of the linked model become the shared coordinates of the host model, based on the position of the linked model instance in the host model. There is no change to the host model's internal coordinates. 
The host model also acquires True North from the linked model. The origin of the linked model's shared coordinates becomes the origin of the host model's shared coordinates. 
When a Revit model acquires coordinates from a linked DWG file, the World Coordinate System (WCS) of the selected linked DWG file becomes the shared coordinate system of the host Revit model, based on the position of the linked DWG instance. The Y axis of the DWG becomes True North, and the origin of the DWG becomes the origin of the shared coordinate system of the Revit model.
On acquiring coordinates from a geo-referenced model, the geolocation information will be pulled from the linked model to the host model.
Unlike UI operation Acquire Coordinates, calling the API would always overwrite the geolocation information in the host model even if it is different from the one in the linked model, or the linked model has empty geolocation information (in which case the geolocation information in the host model would be removed).
