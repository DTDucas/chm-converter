|  | [Dispose](c6fe4067-905b-9f4a-7403-ec7ee52a5ca7.md) | Releases all resources used by the [TessellatedShapeBuilderResult](16e1e032-d9fd-2708-0704-ed00b0b85441.md) |
|  | Equals | Determines whether the specified Object is equal to the current Object. (Inherited from Object.) |
|  | [GetGeometricalObjects](3c5c4efb-8960-869f-76c0-338979e5a484.md) | When called the first time, returns geometrical objects which were built. Later calls will throw exceptions. |
|  | GetHashCode | Serves as a hash function for a particular type.  (Inherited from Object.) |
|  | [GetIssuesForFaceSet](9063460c-2dd8-a00e-6519-8733117870cb.md) | Returns the array of issues encountered while processing a face set with index 'setIndex'. |
|  | [GetNumberOfFaceSets](c5e36953-ef39-f868-f49b-313db8055bcc.md) | Gets number of face sets for which 'this' result was obtained. |

|  | [HasInvalidData](032f5f15-04f3-1257-14a2-2eb47d7bdf36.md) | Whether there were any inconsistencies in the face sets, stored in the tessellated shape builder while building geometrical objects. |
|  | [IsValidObject](8b8076fd-3775-a91b-40f2-fb7145028d66.md) | Specifies whether the .NET object represents a valid Revit entity. |
