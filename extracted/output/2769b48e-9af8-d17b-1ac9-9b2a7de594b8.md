# Properties

|  | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | [IncorrectWallUsageWithAttachedStruct](d0687084-5388-60d1-dc22-9b2268b1b449.md) | A structural framing element is attached to a wall whose Structural Usage is set to [Usage]. |
|  | [InvalidWorkplaneForStructuralFraming](09068ede-0610-41c7-bc37-e71be67c6bc3.md) | Workplane not valid for Structural Framing component "[Family Name]" |
|  | [RemoveTrussSketch](d9d159c0-0aed-af88-b46e-2a6fd251fb13.md) | Remove Sketch |
|  | [TrussBadTransformation](671ef31b-9475-30e0-dc03-cf33b4cf3e8c.md) | Revit cannot transform the truss Layout Family to the Truss as oriented in the project. |
|  | [TrussChordUntransformable](cdfd61d2-1a2f-72e5-b742-fa5909dbdae1.md) | Unable to maintain user changes to unpinned Chord. Restoring Truss-defined shape. |
|  | [TrussDuplicateEngineeringType](9f59960a-bf96-8e42-fdbb-362728f61208.md) | Elements have duplicate 'Engineering Type' values. |
|  | [TrussInvalidSymbolGeom](6f785510-5d44-5efc-f093-1a5030a85daa.md) | Truss is unable to generate any members due to layout family error. |
|  | [TrussIsAttachedTo](3664190b-2c58-dbf7-51a9-39bdb5d9afcd.md) | Revit cannot attach to the chosen Roof/Slab. The truss cannot project to a surface or the attachment creates an invalid profile. |
|  | [TrussLayoutNonSympleTopChord](7f31a2b9-8d1c-23af-3877-7566c21d70ef.md) | This truss layout family defines an offset or non horizontal top chord. This may conflict with attachment or profile editing. |
|  | [TrussLayoutOverlapedCurves](dcd23393-04f4-71a4-01e5-89e0b0239e55.md) | The current transformation of this specific truss layout will some sub members to overlap. |
|  | [TrussNotJoinedWebs](00abe21f-ebd1-edd7-e05c-4f4515b3cbb7.md) | The current edits are causing some webs to disjoin. The truss layout family requires additional constraints to maintain these joins. |
|  | [TrussUserDefinedMemberDeleted](9c5cf96a-abb9-c4e0-4a5a-7a608f8f7b6f.md) | A user-defined structural member was deleted due to missing or deleted references. |
|  | [TrussUserDefinedMemberNotJoined](17459bde-eba2-d87b-be07-fdb15a5f22d9.md) | Both start and end of web must intersect the truss. |
