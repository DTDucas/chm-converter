Id of a Phase at which the Element was created.

# Syntax

    public [ElementId](44f3f7b1-3229-3404-93c9-dc5e70337dd6.md) CreatedPhaseId { get; set; }

    Public Property CreatedPhaseId As [ElementId](44f3f7b1-3229-3404-93c9-dc5e70337dd6.md)
    	Get
    	Set  
  
Visual C++  
---  
      
    
    public:
    property [ElementId](44f3f7b1-3229-3404-93c9-dc5e70337dd6.md)^ CreatedPhaseId {
    	[ElementId](44f3f7b1-3229-3404-93c9-dc5e70337dd6.md)^ get ();
    	void set ([ElementId](44f3f7b1-3229-3404-93c9-dc5e70337dd6.md)^ value);
    }  
  
# Remarks

After setting the property CreatedPhaseId, regeneration can fail if CreatedPhaseId and DemolishedPhaseId are out of order with respect to their index in the property Document.Phases.

When Revit is running with UI activated, the default created phase for newly created elements is inherited from the phase of the currently active view.

When Revit is running without its UI, such as when Revit runs on Autodesk Forge Design Automation API for Revit, the default CreatedPhaseId for newly created elements is the latest phase in Autodesk::Revit::DB::Document::Phases.

# Examples

CopyC#
    
    
    void ShowPhaseCreatedName(Element element)
    {
        // Get the Phase Create property, and assert it should not be null
        Autodesk.Revit.DB.Phase phaseCreated = element.Document.GetElement(element.CreatedPhaseId) as Phase;
        if (null == phaseCreated)
        {
            throw new Exception("Elements always have a phase for when they are created.");
        }
        else
        {
            // Show the Phase Create name to the user.
            String prompt = "The phase created is: " + phaseCreated.Name;
            TaskDialog.Show("Revit",prompt);
        }
    }

CopyVB.NET
    
    
    Private Sub ShowPhaseCreatedName(element As Element)
        ' Get the Phase Create property, and assert it should not be null
        Dim phaseCreated As Autodesk.Revit.DB.Phase = TryCast(element.Document.GetElement(element.CreatedPhaseId), Phase)
        If phaseCreated Is Nothing Then
            Throw New Exception("Elements always have a phase for when they are created.")
        Else
            ' Show the Phase Create name to the user.
            Dim prompt As [String] = "The phase created is: " + phaseCreated.Name
            TaskDialog.Show("Revit", prompt)
        End If
    End Sub
