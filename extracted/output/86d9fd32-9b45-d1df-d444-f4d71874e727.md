# Remarks

By default, panes will be created and shown in the Revit UI when Revit is launched for the first time. Subsequent loads of the Revit UI will determine the visibility of the panes based upon there state at the close of the previous Revit session. Providers can set this to false if they wish there panes to NOT be shown by default.
