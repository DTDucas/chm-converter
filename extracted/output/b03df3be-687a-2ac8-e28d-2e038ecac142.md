    public:
    property [Curve](400cc9b6-9ff7-de85-6fd8-c20002209d25.md)^ Curve {
    	[Curve](400cc9b6-9ff7-de85-6fd8-c20002209d25.md)^ get ();

    }  
  
# Remarks

This property can be used to set the location of curve based element to any desired position. Many elements are curve based. Some examples are walls, beams and braces.

# Examples

CopyC#
    
    
    void MoveUsingCurveParam(Autodesk.Revit.ApplicationServices.Application application, Wall wall)
    {
        LocationCurve wallLine = wall.Location as LocationCurve;
        XYZ p1 = XYZ.Zero;
        XYZ p2 = new XYZ(10, 20, 0);
        Line newWallLine = Line.CreateBound(p1, p2);
    
        // Change the wall line to a new line.
        wallLine.Curve = newWallLine;
    }

CopyVB.NET
    
    
    Private Sub MoveUsingCurveParam(application As Autodesk.Revit.ApplicationServices.Application, wall As Wall)
        Dim wallLine As LocationCurve = TryCast(wall.Location, LocationCurve)
        Dim p1 As XYZ = XYZ.Zero
        Dim p2 As New XYZ(10, 20, 0)
        Dim newWallLine As Line = Line.CreateBound(p1, p2)
    
        ' Change the wall line to a new line.
        wallLine.Curve = newWallLine
    End Sub
