```text
public Curve Curve { get; set; }
```
  
Visual Basic  
---  
```text
Public Property Curve As Curve
	Get
	Set
```
  
Visual C++  
---  
```text
public:
property Curve^ Curve {
	Curve^ get ();
	void set (Curve^ value);
}
```
  
# Remarks
This property can be used to set the location of curve based element to any desired position. Many elements are curve based. Some examples are walls, beams and braces.
# Examples
CopyC#
```text
void MoveUsingCurveParam(Autodesk.Revit.ApplicationServices.Application application, Wall wall)
{
    LocationCurve wallLine = wall.Location as LocationCurve;
    XYZ p1 = XYZ.Zero;
    XYZ p2 = new XYZ(10, 20, 0);
    Line newWallLine = Line.CreateBound(p1, p2);

    // Change the wall line to a new line.
    wallLine.Curve = newWallLine;
}
```

CopyVB.NET
```text
Private Sub MoveUsingCurveParam(application As Autodesk.Revit.ApplicationServices.Application, wall As Wall)
    Dim wallLine As LocationCurve = TryCast(wall.Location, LocationCurve)
    Dim p1 As XYZ = XYZ.Zero
    Dim p2 As New XYZ(10, 20, 0)
    Dim newWallLine As Line = Line.CreateBound(p1, p2)

    ' Change the wall line to a new line.
    wallLine.Curve = newWallLine
End Sub
```
