The [OffsetSurface](178ca56c-d03d-3d1f-c59d-40208e53f88f.md) type exposes the following members.

# Methods

|  | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | [Dispose](c9ee1344-bc19-d833-52e7-dcc4931fe085.md) | (Inherited from [Surface](bb391358-5ca0-578d-e8e2-6d1b30c472d8.md).) |
|  | Equals | Determines whether the specified Object is equal to the current Object. (Inherited from Object.) |
|  | [GetBasisSurface](5fb55047-9bf3-aa08-a0f6-695916946c30.md) | Returns a copy of basis surface of this OffsetSurface. |
|  | [GetBoundingBoxUV](5084214f-219f-780f-fe03-f16b62b2660d.md) | Gets the UV bounding box of the surface.  (Inherited from [Surface](bb391358-5ca0-578d-e8e2-6d1b30c472d8.md).) |
|  | GetHashCode | Serves as a hash function for a particular type.  (Inherited from Object.) |
|  | [GetOffsetDistance](580da623-2d47-9eea-e549-497b32a82d03.md) | Returns offset distance of this OffsetSurface. |
|  | GetType | Gets the Type of the current instance. (Inherited from Object.) |
|  | [IsOrientationSameAsBasisSurface](de30829a-52b3-7afc-ff09-0d891621d289.md) | Indicates whether the orientation of the OffsetSurface is same as that of its basis surface, in the sense that their oriented normals at any (u, v) have the same direction. |
|  | [Project](802cc09b-d0a4-dfc5-8ca1-e8c5e8cd4ced.md) | Project a 3D point orthogonally onto a surface (to find the nearest point). Throws InvalidOperationException if the projection fails.  (Inherited from [Surface](bb391358-5ca0-578d-e8e2-6d1b30c472d8.md).) |
|  | [ProjectWithGuessPoint](db8cc42a-9f34-611a-d9c5-852f3935887f.md) | Project a 3D point orthogonally onto a surface (to find the nearest point). This method is meant to be used when a good approximate solution for the projection is available. Throws InvalidOperationException if the projection fails.  (Inherited from [Surface](bb391358-5ca0-578d-e8e2-6d1b30c472d8.md).) |
|  | ToString | Returns a string that represents the current object. (Inherited from Object.) |
  
# Properties

|  | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | [IsValidObject](6429595a-a6e1-2501-1e60-9c53814a9108.md) | Specifies whether the .NET object represents a valid Revit entity.  (Inherited from [Surface](bb391358-5ca0-578d-e8e2-6d1b30c472d8.md).) |
|  | [OrientationMatchesParametricOrientation](451b549f-2bc4-4f37-9f32-981fe18868a8.md) | Indicates whether this Surface's orientation is the same as or opposite to its parametric orientation.  (Inherited from [Surface](bb391358-5ca0-578d-e8e2-6d1b30c472d8.md).) |
