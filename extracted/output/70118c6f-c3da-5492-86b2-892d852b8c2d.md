    	Set  
  
Visual C++

    public:
    property double EndOffset {
    	double get ();
    	void set (double value);
    }

The direction of the offset is based on the normal of the extrusion's sketch plane: a positive value is in the direction of the normal, a negative value is in the other direction.
