    [TransactionStatus](29b9a7a8-6754-8310-e063-622b569bb6d5.md) Assimilate()  
  
#### Return Value

If finished successfully, this method returns TransactionStatus.Committed. 

# Remarks

After a successful assimilation the transaction group is committed.

All transactions committed inside this group will be merged into one single transaction. The resulting undo item will bear this group's name.

Assimilate can be called only when all inner transaction groups and transactions are finished, i.e. after they were either committed or rolled back.

# Examples

       // a try-catch-finally blocks to guarantee that the group does not out-live its scope.

              // For our compound operation to be considered successful, both the individual
              // transactions must succeed. If either one fails, we will roll our group back,
              // regardless of what transactions might have already been committed.
