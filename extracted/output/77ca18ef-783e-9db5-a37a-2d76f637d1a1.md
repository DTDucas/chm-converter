#### Parameters

point
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..UV](1724be37-059b-91ff-aa74-d1508082f76d.md)The parameters to be evaluated, in natural parameterization of the face.

#### Return Value

A transformation containing tangent vectors and a normal vector.

# Remarks

The following is the meaning of the transformation members: 

  * Origin is the point on the face (equivalent to [Evaluate(UV)](d1219dd7-fc7a-6b12-afce-963d554e947d.md));
  * BasisX is the tangent vector along the U coordinate (partial derivative with respect to U).
  * BasisY is the tangent vector along the V coordinate (partial derivative with respect to V).
  * BasisZ is the underlying surface's normal vector. This is not necessarily aligned with the normal vector pointing out of a solid that contains the face, to get that value use [ComputeNormal(UV)](15377d5b-d369-2e09-98ef-ca0eb0af86a1.md).

None of the vectors are normalized.
