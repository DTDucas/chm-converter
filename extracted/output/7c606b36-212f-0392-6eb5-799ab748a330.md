    property [ScheduleFieldId](e437cc01-b976-fe8a-225a-1a0024171fae.md)^ PercentageBy {

    }  
  
#### Field Value

InvalidElementId or the ID of the grouped field. 

# Remarks

A Percentage field calculates what percent of the total of another field each element represents. If PercentageBy is InvalidScheduleFieldId, the total is of all elements in the schedule. If PercentageBy is the ID of one of the fields that the schedule is grouped by, the total is of all elements in that group.
