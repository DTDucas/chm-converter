|  | [BarsTooCloseNumber](002e7b26-815c-a9e8-e625-3be04e12589d.md) | Bars are too close together. Decrease the Number Of Lines parameter. |
|  | [BarsTooCloseSpacing](f2baf7f0-5379-479f-c63f-f542e8eb3631.md) | Bars are too close together. Increase the Maximum Spacing parameter. |
|  | [BarsTooSparseSpacing](b8d7ea03-8f93-f512-3313-4d179775f3e7.md) | Bar spacing is greater than the size of the reinforced region. Decrease the Maximum Spacing parameter. |
|  | [CannotPlaceAreaReinforcement](441cd6fa-a1a2-c664-8088-253f463dbc21.md) | Can't find a host for Area Reinforcement. |
|  | [CannotPlaceAreaReinforcementWarn](186f1fea-c3b6-705c-1ace-d3e761db86bd.md) | Can't find a host for Area Reinforcement. |
|  | [CannotPlaceAreaReininforcement](eca12543-8ee1-87c1-968d-79f6807f44f0.md) | Can't find a host for Area Reinforcement. |
|  | [CannotPlaceAreaReininforcementWarn](618c5aac-a3e8-5daf-ed76-fa14e54a95d9.md) | Can't find a host for Area Reinforcement. |
|  | [CannotPlacePathReinforcement](9f939915-0b31-83e8-25e4-df2faf92e2c5.md) | Can't find a host for Path Reinforcement. |
|  | [CannotPlacePathReinforcementWarn](e6b54e9c-c7a6-162b-806e-83517c4c60d8.md) | Can't find a host for Path Reinforcement. |
|  | [CannotPlacePathReininforcement](a9b195ef-29ac-ba89-5bbd-4e0306faa6c6.md) | Can't find a host for Path Reinforcement. |
