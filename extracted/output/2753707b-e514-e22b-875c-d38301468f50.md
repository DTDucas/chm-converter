#### Field Value

This string value should be found in the string that makes up the right hand side of the filter entry. If a match is found, that entry from the filter will be shown by default when the dialog is shown. If this value is not set, or it cannot match any of the entries in the filter, it will be ignored, and the first entry in the filter will be used instead.
