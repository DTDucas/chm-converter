This class represents the MEP design to fabrication part convert tool. 

**Namespace:** [Autodesk.Revit.DB.Fabrication](49e74a25-7ea1-efa6-548a-a3c3d0655e43.md)**Assembly:** RevitAPI (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 24.0.0.0 (24.0.0.0)**Since:** 2017

# Remarks

After a new instance of the class is created, call the **Convert** method to convert the MEP design elements into fabrication parts. Use the method **SetMapForFamilySymbolToFabricationPartType** to optionally convert family content to fabrication parts prior to calling **Convert** by providing a mapping of family symbols to fabrication parts types. If not set, then during conversion these families will remain and any connections to other converted elements will be maintained. After the convert method has been invoked, query the class to obtain more information about the conversion: 

  * [GetConvertedFabricationParts()()()()](3461800e-90b9-2961-313d-ceb5c6e48b69.md) to get a set of element identifiers for the newly created fabrication parts.
  * [GetElementsWithOpenConnector()()()()](1b8323a9-dd24-c818-e74c-e29b346000d3.md) to get a set of fabrication part or MEP design element identifiers with open connectors, caused by fittings failing to convert.
