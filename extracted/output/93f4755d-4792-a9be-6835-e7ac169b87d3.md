The number of normals associated with the polymesh 

**Namespace:** [Autodesk.Revit.DB](87546ba7-461b-c646-cbb1-2cb8f5bff8b2.md)**Assembly:** RevitAPI (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 24.0.0.0 (24.0.0.0)**Since:** 2014 

# Syntax

C#  
---  
      
    
    public int NumberOfNormals { get; }  
  
Visual Basic  
---  
      
    
    Public ReadOnly Property NumberOfNormals As Integer
    	Get  
  
Visual C++  
---  
      
    
    public:
    property int NumberOfNormals {
    	int get ();
    }  
  
# Remarks

The number is always equal either to '1', or the number of facets, or the number of points. The DistributionOfNormals property indicates how normals are distributed along the polymesh. If there is only one normal available, it applies to the entire mesh. Curved surfaces have normal vectors associated with either every facet or every point/vertex of the tessellated polymesh.
