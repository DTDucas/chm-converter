viewTemplateId
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..ElementId](44f3f7b1-3229-3404-93c9-dc5e70337dd6.md) If the id of a view template is provided, Temporary View Properties mode is turned on and the settings from the template are applied to the view for the duration of the mode.

If ElementId.InvalidElementId is provided, Temporary View Properties mode is turned off. 

#### Return Value

Returns true when the view template provided by viewTemplateId was applied and Temporary View Properties was successfully turned on. Also returns true if ElementId.InvalidElementId was provided as input and Temporary View Properties was successfully turned off.
