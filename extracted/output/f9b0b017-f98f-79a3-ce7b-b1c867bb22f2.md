# Syntax

C#  
---  
      
    
    public class PerformanceAdviser : IDisposable  
  
Visual Basic  
---  
      
    
    Public Class PerformanceAdviser _
    	Implements IDisposable  
  
Visual C++  
---  
      
    
    public ref class PerformanceAdviser : IDisposable  
  
# Remarks

Class is an application-wide singleton that performs a dual role: it is a repository of rules to run in order to detect potential performance problems as well as an access point to execute checks. 

# Examples

CopyC#
    
    
    //Get the name of each registered PerformanceRule and then execute all of them.
    foreach (PerformanceAdviserRuleId id in PerformanceAdviser.GetPerformanceAdviser().GetAllRuleIds())
    {
        string ruleName = PerformanceAdviser.GetPerformanceAdviser().GetRuleName(id);
    }
    PerformanceAdviser.GetPerformanceAdviser().ExecuteAllRules(document);

CopyVB.NET
    
    
    'Get the name of each registered PerformanceRule and then execute all of them.
    For Each id As PerformanceAdviserRuleId In PerformanceAdviser.GetPerformanceAdviser().GetAllRuleIds()
        Dim ruleName As String = PerformanceAdviser.GetPerformanceAdviser().GetRuleName(id)
    Next
    PerformanceAdviser.GetPerformanceAdviser().ExecuteAllRules(document)
