#### Parameters

pointElementReference
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..PointElementReference](f1548185-45ba-c1c6-8bde-4f9bb0669026.md)An object specifying a rule for the location and orientation of a ReferencePoint. (Note: The ReferencePoint object does not store the pointElementReference object after this call.)

# Remarks

pointElementReference may be nullNothingnullptra null reference (Nothing in Visual Basic), in which case the ReferencePoint does not follow any other element. When Reference is changed from nullNothingnullptra null reference (Nothing in Visual Basic) to a non-null value, the point moves and rotates to the prescribed location and orientation. Where the coordinate system has some freedom, it will remain as close to the old orientation as possible. When the reference is set to nullNothingnullptra null reference (Nothing in Visual Basic), the point does not move or rotate.

# Exceptions

| Exception | Condition |
| --- | --- |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions..::..InvalidOperationException](9e715f03-3884-e539-4dd6-8d7545733adc.md) | Thrown when Reference is set to a non-null object, and the ReferencePoint is unable to move to the new reference. |
