This method provides a direct entry point to get access to an object from the ReCap SDK (ReCapWrapper.RCProject) from Revit. This object represents the point cloud from the RC file path stored in PointCloudType. The ReCap assembly AdskRcManaged.dll will need to be included into code using this method. 

**Namespace:** [Autodesk.Revit.DB](87546ba7-461b-c646-cbb1-2cb8f5bff8b2.md)**Assembly:** RevitAPI (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 24.0.0.0 (24.0.0.0)**Since:** 2022

# Syntax

C#  
---  
      
    
    public RCProject GetReCapProject()  
  
Visual Basic  
---  
      
    
    Public Function GetReCapProject As RCProject  
  
Visual C++  
---  
      
    
    public:
    RCProject^ GetReCapProject()  
  
# Remarks

The coordinate system in RCProject is defined by Point Cloud. Please refer to ReCap SDK document for RCProject::getCoordinateSystem. If you need points converted to the modeling coordinate system in Revit, you can obtain the transformation matrix from PointCloudInstance [GetTransform()()()()](50aa275d-031e-ce19-9cfd-18a7a341ed19.md). 

# Examples

CopyC#
    
    
    private Autodesk.RealityComputing.Managed.RCProject GetRCProject(Document doc)
    {
       PointCloudType type = PointCloudType.Create(doc, "rcs", "c:\\32_cafeteria.rcs");
       // Get RCProject, you need to include AdskRcManaged.dll
       Autodesk.RealityComputing.Managed.RCProject proj = type.GetReCapProject();
       // You can get access to functions from ReCap SDK, for example get total point number of ReCap project
       UInt64 numOfPoints = proj.GetNumberOfPoints();
       return type.GetReCapProject();
    }

CopyVB.NET
    
    
    Private Function GetRCProject(ByVal doc As Document) As Autodesk.RealityComputing.Managed.RCProject
        Dim type As PointCloudType = PointCloudType.Create(doc, "rcs", "c:\32_cafeteria.rcs")
        ' Get RCProject, you need to include AdskRcManaged.dll
        Dim proj As Autodesk.RealityComputing.Managed.RCProject = type.GetReCapProject()
        ' You can get access to functions from ReCap SDK, for example get total point number of ReCap project
        Dim numOfPoints As ULong = proj.GetNumberOfPoints()
        Return type.GetReCapProject()
    End Function
