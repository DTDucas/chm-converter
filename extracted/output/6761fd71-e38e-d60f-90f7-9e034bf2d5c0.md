#### Parameters

filter
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB.PointClouds..::..PointCloudFilter](ca6f916b-2eba-f8e5-8939-1c063330c886.md) The filter to control which points are extracted. The filter should be passed in the coordinates of the Revit model. 

averageDistance
    Type: System..::..Double Desired average distance between "adjacent" cloud points (Revit units of length). The smaller the averageDistance the larger number of points will be returned up to the numPoints limit. Specifying this parameter makes actual number of points returned for a given filter independent of the density of coverage produced by the scanner. 

numPoints
    Type: System..::..Int32 The maximum number of points requested. 

#### Return Value

A collection object containing points that pass the filter, but no more than the maximum number requested. 

# Remarks

If there are more points in the cloud passing the filter than the number requested in this function, the results may not be consistent if the same call is made again. 

# Examples

    private void GetPointCloudDataByIteration(PointCloudInstance pcInstance, PointCloudFilter pointCloudFilter)
    {
        // read points by iteration
        double averageDistance = 0.001;
        int numberOfPoints= 10000;
        // Get points. Number of points is determined by the needs of the client. 
        PointCollection points = pcInstance.GetPoints(pointCloudFilter, averageDistance, numberOfPoints);
        foreach (CloudPoint point in points)
        {
            // Process each point 
            System.Drawing.Color color = System.Drawing.ColorTranslator.FromWin32(point.Color);
            String pointDescription = String.Format("({0}, {1}, {2}, {3}", point.X, point.Y, point.Z, color.ToString());
        }
    }
    // read points by pointer
    public unsafe void GetPointCloudDataByPointer(PointCloudInstance pcInstance, PointCloudFilter pointCloudFilter)
    {
        double averageDistance = 0.001;
        int numOfPoints = 10000;
        // Get points. Number of points is determined by the needs of the client.
        PointCollection points = pcInstance.GetPoints(pointCloudFilter, averageDistance, numOfPoints);
        CloudPoint* pointBuffer = (CloudPoint*)points.GetPointBufferPointer().ToPointer();
        int totalCount = points.Count;
        for (int numberOfPoints = 0; numberOfPoints < totalCount; numberOfPoints++)
        {
            CloudPoint point = *(pointBuffer + numberOfPoints);
            // Process each point 
            System.Drawing.Color color = System.Drawing.ColorTranslator.FromWin32(point.Color);
