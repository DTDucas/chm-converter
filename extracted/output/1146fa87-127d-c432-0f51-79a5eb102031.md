    public:
    [TransactionStatus](29b9a7a8-6754-8310-e063-622b569bb6d5.md) Start()  
  
#### Return Value

If finished successfully, this method returns TransactionStatus.Started. Note that unless starting is successful, changes cannot be made to the document. 

# Remarks

A transaction may be started only after it was instantiated or after it was previously committed or rolled back. In order to start a transaction, it must have a name assigned. If the name was not specified when the transaction object was instantiated, it has to be set by calling the [SetName(String)](c0283e7f-d261-6016-724c-31ae5cde96a7.md) method.

Be aware that every time a transaction starts, [Failure Handling Options](c03bb2e5-f679-bf24-4e87-08b3c3a08385.md) will be reset to their default values. If a specific failure handling is required, programmers need to use [SetFailureHandlingOptions(FailureHandlingOptions)](1e913cca-f75b-8dfb-b172-5a04f3732b85.md) before the transaction is committed or rolled back.

# Exceptions

| Exception | Condition |
| --- | --- |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions..::..InvalidOperationException](9e715f03-3884-e539-4dd6-8d7545733adc.md) | Cannot modify the document for either a read-only external command is being executed, or changes to the document are temporarily disabled. -or- The transaction's document is currently in failure mode. No transaction operations are permitted until failure handling is finished. -or- The transaction started already and has not been completed yet. -or- Starting a new transaction is not permitted. It could be because another transaction already started and has not been completed yet, or the document is in a state in which it cannot start a new transaction (e.g. during failure handling or a read-only mode, which could be either permanent or temporary). -or- The transaction does not have a valid name assigned yet. |
