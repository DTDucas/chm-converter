Starts the transaction. 
**Namespace:** [Autodesk.Revit.DB](87546ba7-461b-c646-cbb1-2cb8f5bff8b2.md "Autodesk.Revit.DB Namespace")**Assembly:** RevitAPI (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 24.0.0.0 (24.0.0.0)
# Syntax

TransactionStatus Start()
```
  
# ### Return Value
If finished successfully, this method returns TransactionStatus.Started. Note that unless starting is successful, changes cannot be made to the document. 
# Remarks
A transaction may be started only after it was instantiated or after it was previously committed or rolled back. In order to start a transaction, it must have a name assigned. If the name was not specified when the transaction object was instantiated, it has to be set by calling the [SetName(String)](c0283e7f-d261-6016-724c-31ae5cde96a7.md "SetName Method") method.
Be aware that every time a transaction starts, [Failure Handling Options](c03bb2e5-f679-bf24-4e87-08b3c3a08385.md "FailureHandlingOptions Class") will be reset to their default values. If a specific failure handling is required, programmers need to use [SetFailureHandlingOptions(FailureHandlingOptions)](1e913cca-f75b-8dfb-b172-5a04f3732b85.md "SetFailureHandlingOptions Method") before the transaction is committed or rolled back.

    XYZ end = new XYZ(10, 10, 0);
    Autodesk.Revit.DB.Line geomLine = Line.CreateBound(start, end);

    // All and any transaction should be enclosed in a 'using'
    // block or guarded within a try-catch-finally blocks
    // to guarantee that a transaction does not out-live its scope.

           // get the value of Geometry and AnalyticalModel.

| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions..::..InvalidOperationException](9e715f03-3884-e539-4dd6-8d7545733adc.md "InvalidOperationException Class") | Cannot modify the document for either a read-only external command is being executed, or changes to the document are temporarily disabled. -or- The transaction's document is currently in failure mode. No transaction operations are permitted until failure handling is finished. -or- The transaction started already and has not been completed yet. -or- Starting a new transaction is not permitted. It could be because another transaction already started and has not been completed yet, or the document is in a state in which it cannot start a new transaction (e.g. during failure handling or a read-only mode, which could be either permanent or temporary). -or- The transaction does not have a valid name assigned yet. |
