    static bool SortPoints(
    	[ReferencePointArray](4780adea-9e68-b0b4-09c7-68f7752dd650.md)^ arr

#### Parameters

arr
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..ReferencePointArray](4780adea-9e68-b0b4-09c7-68f7752dd650.md)An array of ReferencePoints. The array is reordered if sortPoints returns true, and is unchanged if sortPoints returns false.

#### Return Value

False if the least-squares method is unable to find a solution; true otherwise.

# Remarks

Finds a best-fit line to the points by the least squares method, and orders the points by their projection onto the line.
