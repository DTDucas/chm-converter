# Remarks

Global print settings include PrintToFile, CombinedFile, PrintToFileName, PrintRange, CopyNumber, PrintOrderReverse, Collate. Once PrintManager is acquired from a document, changes of its global print setting properties are not automatically applied toward the global print setting. Should the local setting be used, the user needs to call the Apply method. If the user calls SubmitPrint methods, not only that printing will use the current state of properties of the (local) print manager, but the setting will also be applied to the global settings. 

# Examples

CopyC#
    
    
    private void CreateAndPrintViewSet(Document document, ViewSet viewSet)
    {
        PrintManager printManager = document.PrintManager;
        printManager.PrintRange = PrintRange.Select;
        ViewSheetSetting viewSheetSetting = printManager.ViewSheetSetting;
        viewSheetSetting.CurrentViewSheetSet.Views = viewSet;
        viewSheetSetting.SaveAs("MyViewSet");
        printManager.CombinedFile = true;
        printManager.SubmitPrint();
    }

CopyVB.NET
    
    
    Private Sub CreateAndPrintViewSet(document As Document, viewSet As ViewSet)
        Dim printManager As PrintManager = document.PrintManager
        printManager.PrintRange = PrintRange.[Select]
        Dim viewSheetSetting As ViewSheetSetting = printManager.ViewSheetSetting
        viewSheetSetting.CurrentViewSheetSet.Views = viewSet
        viewSheetSetting.SaveAs("MyViewSet")
        printManager.CombinedFile = True
        printManager.SubmitPrint()
    End Sub
