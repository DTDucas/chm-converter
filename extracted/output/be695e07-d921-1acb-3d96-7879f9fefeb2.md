# Remarks

This property is only available when [Layout](81018421-ab61-9115-b171-c359e557f49e.md) is equal to FixedNumber. Lines will be placed exactly at the boundaries if possible, so if your region is 100' long and you specify Number = 11, your lines will be 10' apart. Must be between 1 and 200.
