#### Parameters

document
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..Document](db03274b-a107-aa32-9034-f3e0df4bb1ec.md) The document to which the new View3D will be added. 

viewFamilyTypeId
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..ElementId](44f3f7b1-3229-3404-93c9-dc5e70337dd6.md) The id of the ViewFamilyType which will be used by the new View3D. The type needs to be a ThreeDimensional ViewType. 

#### Return Value

The new isometric View3D. 

# Remarks

The new View3D will receive a unique view name. The view will be oriented in the same position as the default 3D view. 

# Examples

CopyVB.NET
    
    
    ' Find a 3D view type
    Dim collector1 As New FilteredElementCollector(document)
    collector1 = collector1.OfClass(GetType(ViewFamilyType))
    Dim viewFamilyTypes As IEnumerable(Of ViewFamilyType)
    
    viewFamilyTypes = From elem In collector1 _
                      Let vftype = TryCast(elem, ViewFamilyType) _
                      Where vftype.ViewFamily = ViewFamily.ThreeDimensional _
                      Select vftype
    ' Create a new View3D
    Dim view3D__1 As View3D = View3D.CreateIsometric(document, viewFamilyTypes.First().Id)
    If view3D__1 IsNot Nothing Then
        ' By default, the 3D view uses a default orientation.
        ' Change the orientation by creating and setting a ViewOrientation3D
        Dim eye As New XYZ(10, 10, 10)
        Dim up As New XYZ(0, 1, 1)
        Dim forward As New XYZ(0, 1, -1)
        Dim viewOrientation3D As New ViewOrientation3D(eye, up, forward)
        view3D__1.SetOrientation(viewOrientation3D)
    End If
