Add a definition to be reused by instances. Adding a definition type will change how the instances are created. When asked to create a definition, the library object will look for a corresponding type object. If one is found, it will create an instance of geometry stored in the type object. If it is not found, the library will look for a list of geometry objects stored as definition, and will copy and transform these to create an instance.
