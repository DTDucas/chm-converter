#### Parameters

wallSweepInfo
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..WallSweepInfo](140876fa-4c17-ad27-8a12-a4bf755e06f3.md) The wall sweep info to create a wall sweep. 

# Remarks

A wall sweep is an object that is created by sweeping a closed 2d profile along a horizontal line that is positioned on one side (exterior or interior) of the hosting wall. A reveal is a special wall sweep with a void shape that is subtracted from the hosting wall.

The id field of the WallSweepInfo must be populated with a non-negative integer value. If there already is a sweep defined for this id, its parameters will be changed. A new sweep will be created if no existing one has matching id.
