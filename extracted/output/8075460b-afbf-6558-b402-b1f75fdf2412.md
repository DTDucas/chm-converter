# Remarks

A failure could have several permitted resolutions. List of applicable resolution types for the specific failure is defined by the FailureDefinition, actual FailureResolutions are instantiated with the FailureMessage before it is posted. Multiple resolutions per failure are allowed, although Revit UI only uses default resolution.
