# Remarks
This event is raised immediately after Revit has finished opening a linked resource. Only supports linked resources for following types : Revit; IFC; CAD(dwg, dxf, dgn, sat); Topography; It is raised even when a linked resource opening failed. The LinkedResourceOpened events would not raised if there are no update on linked CAD, IFC resources. 
Check the 'Status' field in event's argument to see whether the action itself was successful or not.
Another [LinkedResourceOpening](54d34744-25e2-4e7b-87ef-695aa00fe899.md "LinkedResourceOpening Event") event will be raised when Revit is just about to open a linked resource.
