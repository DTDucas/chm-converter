# Remarks

This object contains the definition of the hooks that may be created at the ends of the rebar. The specifics of these hooks are angle (range 0-PI) between first/last segment of rebar and the straight segment of the hook, rebar shape style and a multiplier used to compute the length of the straight segment of the hook. The default length is computed as the bar diameter * the multiplier. Length can be overridden by settings in the RebarBarType class.
