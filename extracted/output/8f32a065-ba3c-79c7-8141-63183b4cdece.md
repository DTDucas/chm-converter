# Remarks

Splitting is permitted for architectural and structural columns, beams and braces. Beams and braces that are not a line or an arc is not permitted. See [CanSplit](a5075af4-0664-ed10-8303-665f0024c30a.md) to determine if the family instance is allowed to be split by this method.

Splitting modifies this family instance and adds a second family instance to the model.
