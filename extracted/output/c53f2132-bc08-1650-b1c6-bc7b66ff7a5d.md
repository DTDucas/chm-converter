    [Face](e32b3b1f-66fc-57cb-6e1c-aa81d1bf3e63.md)^ GetSubface()  
  
#### Return Value

The sub-face. 

# Remarks

If the spatial element's face is adjacent to multiple bounding elements (such as two different walls), there will be one sub-face for each portion of the spatial element's face where it is adjacent to one of those room-bounding elements. This is equivalent to the return of GetRoomFace() if the entire room face is created by the boundary element.
