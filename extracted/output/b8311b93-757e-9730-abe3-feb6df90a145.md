# Constructors

| [TessellatedFace(IList<(Of <<'(XYZ>)>>), ElementId)](762318a9-e737-8ef1-578b-5be176d28624.md "TessellatedFace Constructor \(IList\(XYZ\), ElementId\)") | Constructs a tessellated face without holes. Face data is always set, even if the input data are invalid (e.g., describes a wildly non-planar face). A TessellatedShepeBuilder's function is used to check the data and heal them if possible. |
| [TessellatedFace(IList<(Of <<'(IList<(Of <<'(XYZ>)>>)>)>>), ElementId)](b8dcecf2-a4a8-8517-6735-f253e5e203b9.md "TessellatedFace Constructor \(IList\(IList\(XYZ\)\), ElementId\)") | Constructs a tessellated face, which, may be, have holes. Face data is always set, even if the input data are invalid (e.g., describes a wildly non-planar face). A TessellatedShepeBuilder's function is used to check the data and heal them if possible. |
