|  | [TessellatedFace(IList<(Of <<'(XYZ>)>>), ElementId)](762318a9-e737-8ef1-578b-5be176d28624.md) | Constructs a tessellated face without holes. Face data is always set, even if the input data are invalid (e.g., describes a wildly non-planar face). A TessellatedShepeBuilder's function is used to check the data and heal them if possible. |
