Transactions are context-like objects that guard any changes made to a Revit model

# Remarks

Any change to a document can only be made while there is an active transaction open for that document. Changes do not become part of the document until the active transaction is [committed](32714010-7138-f64f-8fde-a310354448e3.md). Consequently, all changes made in a transaction can be [rolled back](bd1e69e9-961e-1c07-f70a-a29b90c6eb97.md) either explicitly or implicitly by the transaction's destructor.

A document can have only one transaction open at any given time.

Transactions cannot be started when the document is in read-only mode, either permanently or temporarily. See the Document class methods IsReadOnly and IsModifiable for more details.

Transactions in linked documents are not permitted, for linked documents are not allowed to be modified.

If a transaction was started and not finished yet by the time the Transaction object is about to be disposed, the default destructor will roll it back automatically, thus all changes made to the document while this transaction was open will be discarded. It is not recommended to rely on this default behavior though. Instead, it is advised to always call either [Commit](32714010-7138-f64f-8fde-a310354448e3.md) or [RollBack](bd1e69e9-961e-1c07-f70a-a29b90c6eb97.md) explicitly before the transaction object gets disposed. Please note that unless invoked explicitly the actual destruction of an object in managed code might not happen until the object is collected by the garbage collector.
