# Methods

|  | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | Equals | Determines whether the specified Object is equal to the current Object. (Inherited from Object.) |
|  | GetHashCode | Serves as a hash function for a particular type.  (Inherited from Object.) |

# Properties

|  | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | [HasLeader](2cd13188-00bb-784f-17dd-b2c130f34b08.md) | Specifies if the label will have a leader. The default value is true. |
|  | [LeaderEnd](e6e365cc-fc8c-31e2-a604-14ecf78c6374.md) | Specifies the leader end point, in model coordinates. The default value is null. When null, the end point will be the same as the [Origin](df8b9dc6-9d36-ac2b-04cf-816d88f039b8.md) point, driven by the [Station](215afd0a-ff0e-1a8e-fc74-be36e7ad4d77.md) value. |
|  | [LeaderShoulder](e2c8a9bd-31cd-3ff8-2aa2-90adb02493cc.md) | Specifies the leader shoulder point, in model coordinates. The default value is null. When null, the shoulder point will be the same as the [Origin](df8b9dc6-9d36-ac2b-04cf-816d88f039b8.md) point, driven by the [Station](215afd0a-ff0e-1a8e-fc74-be36e7ad4d77.md) value. |
|  | [Station](215afd0a-ff0e-1a8e-fc74-be36e7ad4d77.md) | Specifies the station at which the label will be placed, in Revit internal model units (standard Imperial feet). The station determines the location of the label's origin: [Origin](df8b9dc6-9d36-ac2b-04cf-816d88f039b8.md) by setting it to the closest point on the alignment geometry which corresponds to this station. |
|  | [TypeId](86352cb2-b367-a806-7427-2fb08e50b425.md) | Specifies the ElementId of the label type. The default value is InvalidElementId. In this case, the default type id for alignment station labels in the document is used. |
