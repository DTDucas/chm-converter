# Methods

|  | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | [AlmostEqual](91717709-a62e-9880-527e-d52a9a0ae048.md) | Determines whether this transformation and the specified transformation are the same within the tolerance (1.0e-09). |
|  | [CreateReflection](7c6c9293-64ca-ef47-3365-803e7f802883.md) | Creates a transform that represents a reflection across the given plane. |
|  | [CreateRotation](01cddc01-b348-3c51-d2ad-c61ac64c6da4.md) | Creates a transform that represents a rotation about the given axis at (0, 0, 0). |
|  | [CreateRotationAtPoint](8da64cca-bea9-4750-1f79-f6de3867191e.md) | Creates a transform that represents a rotation about the given axis at the specified point. |
|  | [CreateTranslation](b1a26f8c-1593-5b74-d78e-d4261ec5ebe5.md) | Creates a transform that represents a translation via the specified vector. |
|  | [Dispose](7c03212a-b587-1c89-3912-efea0d2619c5.md) | Causes the object to release immediately any resources it may be utilizing. (Inherited from [APIObject](beb86ef5-39ad-3f0d-0cd9-0c929387a2bb.md).) |
|  | Equals | Determines whether the specified Object is equal to the current Object. (Inherited from Object.) |
|  | GetHashCode | Serves as a hash function for a particular type.  (Inherited from Object.) |
|  | GetType | Gets the Type of the current instance. (Inherited from Object.) |
|  | [Multiply](dca45f2a-e404-765e-4bb8-cf39982bf034.md) | Multiplies this transformation by the specified transformation and returns the result. |
|  | [OfPoint](55c834aa-ef75-f6f1-4c89-d908d842e9d6.md) | Applies the transformation to the point and returns the result. |
|  | [OfVector](4d5b7075-1b79-639d-5da2-eb23372bc888.md) | Applies the transform to the vector |
|  | [ScaleBasis](35360886-77c5-4117-e395-b83b95f9c884.md) | Scales the basis vectors of this transformation and returns the result. |
|  | [ScaleBasisAndOrigin](460caa53-d288-7cfe-dbb8-eadf4682329d.md) | Scales the basis vectors and the origin of this transformation and returns the result. |
|  | ToString | Returns a string that represents the current object. (Inherited from Object.) |
