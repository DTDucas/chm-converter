# Members

| Member name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Invalid | Special (reserved) type. This should be non-initialized value of any variable of FailureResolutionType, end user should not see this value, API programmer could use this in initialization and comparison. |
| Default | Special (reserved) type. It cannot be used as a type when defining a resolution, but can be used as a key to query default resolution from FailureMessage or FailureDefinition. |
| CreateElements | Defines a resolution of a failure where Revit will add new Element(s) in place of missing one(s). |
| DeleteElements | Defines a resolution of a failure by deleting Element(s) that caused the failure. |
| SkipElements | Defines a resolution of a failure by skipping Element(s) for which operation has failed and proceeding with the rest of Elements. |
| MoveElements | Defines a resolution of a failure by moving Element(s) to an appropriate location. |
| FixElements | Defines a resolution of a failure by changing failing Element(s) - specific change may vary depending in type of failure and type of Element(s). |
| DetachElements | Defines a resolution of a failure by removing invalid relationships between elements such as joined walls and roofs, grouped elements, and associated curves. |
| QuitEditMode | Defines a resolution of a failure by quitting an Edit Mode instead of committing changes. Changes made in edit mode will be rolled back. |
| UnlockConstraints | Defines a resolution of a failure by unconstraining Element(s). |
| SetValue | Defines a resolution of a failure by setting an appropriate value in place of invalid value. |
| SaveDocument | Save the current document to avoid losing more if something serious occurs. |
| ShowElements | The standard "Show" may fail in some context, special resolution could be added in this condition to show failing element(s). |
| Others | Resolution type does not match any of the above. |
