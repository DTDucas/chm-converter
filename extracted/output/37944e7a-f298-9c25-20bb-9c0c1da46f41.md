# Remarks

This property will be the first room encountered that contains the instance. If more than one room includes this point in its volume only the first one is returned. If no room is found that contains the instance, or if phase does not apply to this FaimlyInstance, this property is nullNothingnullptra null reference (Nothing in Visual Basic). This property should not be used for door or window instances, which are placed on the boundary or between rooms. Use the [FromRoom](d6658841-da29-ead4-049b-3036cbd4951a.md) and [ToRoom](939e9c7b-072a-7be9-105f-64e1aa1f3a97.md) properties instead.
