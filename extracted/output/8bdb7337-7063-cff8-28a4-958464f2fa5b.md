    [Group](ca54af3c-52d8-0aed-cd22-440ec2584b89.md)^ NewGroup(

    )  
  
#### Parameters

elementIds
    Type: System.Collections.Generic..::..ICollection<(Of <(<'[ElementId](44f3f7b1-3229-3404-93c9-dc5e70337dd6.md)>)>)>A set of elements which will be made into the new group.

#### Return Value

A new instance of a group containing the elements specified.

# Remarks

  * The new group may contain more members than just the set input to this method. Elements which are closely connected with the inputs (such as sketch and sketch plane) will also be added to the group.
  * Initially the group will have a generic name, such as Group 1. This can be changed by changing the name of the group type as follows: newGroup.GroupType.Name = newName.
  * If a newly-created element is being added to a group, calling document.Regenerate() may be needed to avoid a warning visible in the UI that the group has changed outside group edit mode.



# Examples

CopyC#
    
    
    Group group = null;
    UIDocument uidoc = new UIDocument(document);
    ICollection<ElementId> selectedIds = uidoc.Selection.GetElementIds();
    
    if (selectedIds.Count > 0)
    {
        // Group all selected elements
        group = document.Create.NewGroup(selectedIds);
    
    }

CopyVB.NET
    
    
    Dim group As Group = Nothing
    Dim uidoc As New UIDocument(document)
    Dim selectedIds As ICollection(Of ElementId) = uidoc.Selection.GetElementIds()
    
    If selectedIds.Count > 0 Then
        ' Group all selected elements
    
    
        group = document.Create.NewGroup(selectedIds)
    Else
