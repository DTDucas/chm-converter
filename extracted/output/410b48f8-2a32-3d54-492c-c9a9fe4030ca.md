| Invalid | This value is the uninitialized value for the enum. It indicates that the link has not been properly initialized. |
| Loaded | The link is loaded. |
| Unloaded | The link is unloaded. |
| Imported | The element represented by this value was imported into Revit rather than linked into Revit. |
| NotFound | The linked file was not able to be found the last time Revit tried to load it. |
| CanBeUpgraded | The linked point cloud file is obsolete and can be indexed into new format. |
| InClosedWorkset | The linked file is in a closed workset and will not be displayed. |
| LocallyUnloaded | The linked file is unloaded for the specific user. (If the linked file is both unloaded for the specific user and unloaded for all users, the link will report LinkedFileStatus.Unloaded.) |
