# Remarks

This service works with pipe fitting and accessory pressure drop service. It provides the settings for the pipe fitting and accessory pressure drop server if needed; and it also provides UI for user to input the settings in Revit. A typical way to use the external server can be: 

  * Implement a server class that derives from this interface 
  * Create a new server object and register it with the service.
