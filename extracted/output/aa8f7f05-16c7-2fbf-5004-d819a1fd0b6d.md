# Remarks

Worksets are a way to divide a set of elements in the Revit document into subsets for worksharing. There may be one or many worksets in a document. Each element in the document must belong to one and only one workset. 

# Examples

CopyC#
    
    
    public Workset GetActiveWorkset(Document doc)
    {
        // Get the workset table from the document
        WorksetTable worksetTable = doc.GetWorksetTable();
        // Get the Id of the active workset
        WorksetId activeId = worksetTable.GetActiveWorksetId();
        // Find the workset with that Id 
        Workset workset = worksetTable.GetWorkset(activeId);
        return workset;
    }

CopyVB.NET
    
    
    Public Function GetActiveWorkset(doc As Document) As Workset
        ' Get the workset table from the document
        Dim worksetTable As WorksetTable = doc.GetWorksetTable()
        ' Get the Id of the active workset
        Dim activeId As WorksetId = worksetTable.GetActiveWorksetId()
        ' Find the workset with that Id 
        Dim workset As Workset = worksetTable.GetWorkset(activeId)
        Return workset
    End Function
