# Syntax

C#

    public bool ComputeVolumes { get; set; }  
  
Visual Basic  
---  
      
    
    Public Property ComputeVolumes As Boolean
    	Get
    	Set  
  
Visual C++  
---  
      
    
    public:
    property bool ComputeVolumes {
    	bool get ();
    	void set (bool value);
    }  
  
# Remarks

When this setting is False, rooms and spaces will be treated as simple extrusions of their 2d boundaries. The volume parameter will report "not computed". When this setting is True, the geometry of rooms and spaces will be trimmed when it intersects elements such as ceilings, roofs, and floors. 

# Examples

CopyC#
    
    
    public void GetRoomDimensions(Document doc, Room room)
    {
        String roominfo = "Room dimensions:\n";
        // turn on volume calculations:
        using (Transaction t = new Transaction(doc, "Turn on volume calculation"))
        {
            t.Start();
            AreaVolumeSettings settings = AreaVolumeSettings.GetAreaVolumeSettings(doc);
            settings.ComputeVolumes = true;
            t.Commit();
        }
    
        roominfo += "Vol: " + room.Volume + "\n";
        roominfo += "Area: " + room.Area + "\n";
        roominfo += "Perimeter: " + room.Perimeter + "\n";
        roominfo += "Unbounded height: " + room.UnboundedHeight + "\n";
        TaskDialog.Show("Revit",roominfo);
    }

CopyVB.NET
    
    
    Public Sub GetRoomDimensions(doc As Document, room As Room)
        Dim roominfo As [String] = "Room dimensions:" & vbLf
        ' turn on volume calculations:
        Using t As New Transaction(doc, "Turn on volume calculation")
            t.Start()
            Dim settings As AreaVolumeSettings = AreaVolumeSettings.GetAreaVolumeSettings(doc)
            settings.ComputeVolumes = True
            t.Commit()
        End Using
    
        roominfo += "Vol: " & Convert.ToString(room.Volume) & vbLf
        roominfo += "Area: " & Convert.ToString(room.Area) & vbLf
        roominfo += "Perimeter: " & Convert.ToString(room.Perimeter) & vbLf
