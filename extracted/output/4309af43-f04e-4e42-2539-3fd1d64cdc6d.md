An interface that is used in custom export to export 3D views of a Revit model. 

**Namespace:** [Autodesk.Revit.DB](87546ba7-461b-c646-cbb1-2cb8f5bff8b2.md)**Assembly:** RevitAPI (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 24.0.0.0 (24.0.0.0)**Since:** 2016

# Remarks

An instance of a class that implements this interface is passed in as a parameter of the [CustomExporter](d2437433-9183-cbb1-1c67-dedd86db5b5a.md) constructor. The interface methods are then called at times of drawing entities that are currently visible in the view being exported.

With this type of export context used to perform a custom export, Revit will traverse the model and output the model's geometry as if in the process of regular displaying or exporting a 3D View. It means that any geometry which is visible in an open view (taking any current visibility setting applicable to the view) will be processed and output.
