The [PartMakerMethodToDivideVolumes](611ca5f7-3ffb-6f83-3aaf-df4533038ed0.md) type exposes the following members.

# Properties

|  | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | [DivisionGap](c4ca59b9-8b0a-a57c-5eff-e2e6ec71fb40.md) | The gap which is created between matching profiles of parts. |
|  | [DivisionPatternMirror](097e121c-7a54-157c-9556-1f1ee1331216.md) | Whether pattern defined by the division rule should be mirrored before application Mirroring is similar to changing indices of u-const gridlines. |
|  | [DivisionRotationAngle](d25dc463-5722-7434-05c7-4986b0a08d66.md) | Angle by which both u- and v- gridlines of the division are rotated with respect to the natural u/v-const directions of the sketch plane. |
|  | [DivisionRuleId](fd62adc1-005d-59b9-cfde-ab413cc7d0f9.md) | Id of the 'DivisionRule' which is used to augment the cutting sketch. |
|  | [IsValidObject](696ea72e-f7df-ff11-cb64-6416cadf9ca0.md) | Specifies whether the .NET object represents a valid Revit entity. |
|  | [ProfileFlipAcross](97693c2b-8820-38af-d34d-284c4a8b0cf2.md) | True if the corresponding left/upper parts profile are mirrored with respect to the division line. False if the profile of left/upper parts are defined directly by the profile family. |
|  | [ProfileFlipAlong](1444910d-3d51-3266-cdd4-0310bf763280.md) | True if the corresponding left/upper parts profile are mirrored with respect to the center line of the hosts to be divided. False if the profile of left/upper parts are defined directly by the profile family. |
|  | [ProfileMatch](d942aaf3-8ad2-2c28-4f67-3c5252213b55.md) | Determines how two profiles match. |
|  | [ProfileOffset](a6acee14-128e-9508-e41b-73bb6dee0804.md) | The offset which is applied to a family-defined profile in the direction away from the division line and toward left/upper part to obtain its profile. |
|  | [ProfileType](34bd82bc-f067-f9f9-6aea-e5fc8990dbe7.md) | The id of the profile family applied to boundaries between parts. |
|  | [UConstDivisionIndent](338f115d-248d-3377-e43b-9169a72f6a05.md) | Indentation for the application of division rule's pattern across u-const gridlines (i.e., similar to changing indices of u-const gridlines). |
|  | [VConstDivisionIndent](f4e7e5e1-9fce-34f0-7d1c-25c0b97f8012.md) | Indentation for the application of division rule's pattern across v-const gridlines (i.e., similar to changing indices of v-const gridlines). |
