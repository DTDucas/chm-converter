# Syntax

C#  
---  
      
    
    public int LevelOfDetail { get; set; }  
  
Visual Basic  
---  
      
    
    Public Property LevelOfDetail As Integer
    	Get
    	Set  
  
Visual C++  
---  
      
    
    public:
    property int LevelOfDetail {
    	int get ();
    	void set (int value);
    }  
  
# Remarks

The value is an integer number in range of [0,15] (inclusive), or a value {-1}. If the value is positive, Revit will use the suggested level of detail when tessellating faces; otherwise it will use its default algorithm, which is based on output resolution. 

If an explicit level of detail is requested (i.e. a positive value), using a value close to the middle of the valid range yields a very reasonable tessellation. Revit uses level 8 as its 'normal' LoD.
