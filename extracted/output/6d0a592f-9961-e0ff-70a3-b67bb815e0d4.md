#### Parameters

node
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..PointNode](02661c46-c644-c4d8-2db2-11d9fb30b20e.md) An output node that represents a Point. 

#### Return Value

Return RenderNodeAction.Proceed if you wish to receive low-level geometry (line segments) for this point, or otherwise return RenderNodeAction.Skip. 

# Remarks

Note that this method is invoked only if the custom exporter was set up to include geometric objects in the output stream. See [IncludeGeometricObjects](2ce1075e-380e-01e7-6459-b7467c2a2414.md) for mode details.
