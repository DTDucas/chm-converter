# Members

| Member name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Complement | Before division gap is applied the left/upper and right/lower profiles coincide and neighboring panels complement each other precisely. |
| Mirrored | Right/lower profile is obtained by mirroring the left/upper profile with respect to the division line. The division gap is not applied. |
| MirroredAndRotated | Right/lower profile is obtained first by mirroring the left/upper profile with respect to the division line and then by mirroring the result with respect to the center line of the divided thickness. The division gap is not applied. |
  
# Remarks

A family-based profile defines the shape of the left/upper profile and this value defines how a matching right/lower profile is obtained.
