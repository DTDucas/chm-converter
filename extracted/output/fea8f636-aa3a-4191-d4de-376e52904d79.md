The [ViewShapeBuilder](f99edd24-4519-56d5-a5d6-aa1565a893af.md) type exposes the following members.

# Properties

|  | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | [IsValidObject](6a5c7474-6ea6-4886-d356-204405406596.md) | Specifies whether the .NET object represents a valid Revit entity.  (Inherited from [ShapeBuilder](66c1678c-2e01-e0de-1386-5a0e1eb3ccff.md).) |
|  | [ViewNormal](a58d3c20-3181-899b-c583-98f2f9c94713.md) | Normal of the view that will display the shape being built. Must be set explicitly before adding any geometry. Must be a unit vector. This is used to validate incoming geometry - it must be orthogonal to the viewNormal. |
|  | [ViewType](7dc1fc02-b8f5-6552-54c4-6cce64119c39.md) | View type where the view-specific shape currently being built will be used |
