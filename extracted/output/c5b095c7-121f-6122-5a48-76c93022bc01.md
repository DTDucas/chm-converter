The [RebarShapeDefinitionBySegments](7229fdba-1e8f-6cb7-e72e-0933e495ad62.md) type exposes the following members.

# Properties

|  | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | [Complete](570cadd6-28ca-7828-dd6a-0e4bcb53256a.md) | Report whether the shape definition is fully constrained.  (Inherited from [RebarShapeDefinition](bb1f59be-c95e-a45b-8d2b-8121df179676.md).) |
|  | [IsPlanar](a401ad32-ed12-66d3-2f50-09039d112c25.md) | Reports whether the shape definition lies within a plane: false if a spiral, true in all other cases.  (Inherited from [RebarShapeDefinition](bb1f59be-c95e-a45b-8d2b-8121df179676.md).) |
|  | [IsValidObject](47e5ab9c-5b4a-fc69-6745-89b296cc0900.md) | Specifies whether the .NET object represents a valid Revit entity.  (Inherited from [RebarShapeDefinition](bb1f59be-c95e-a45b-8d2b-8121df179676.md).) |
|  | [MajorSegmentIndex](fd0d677f-aad6-cb00-1b8f-9bd05a6f3dc6.md) | Index of a segment that can be considered the most important. Revit attempts to preserve the orientation of this segment when a Rebar instance changes its RebarShape to one with a different number of segments. |
|  | [NumberOfSegments](4891447d-bf90-1246-86f7-95e4f849f9b4.md) | The number of straight segments in this shape. |
|  | [NumberOfVertices](2a9082e8-eba4-e0d5-6fd0-6bd4874c8c0a.md) | The number of vertices in this shape, always equal to NumberOfSegments + 1. |
