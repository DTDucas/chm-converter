# Properties

|  | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | [Fallback](59acf1d0-742a-45eb-df1c-edbb136279a4.md) | Defines acceptable fallback if the desired type of geometry can't be built. |
|  | [GraphicsStyleId](b52fe304-95a0-77c8-4b4c-e3c18c16677d.md) | Optional - if set, the built geometry will use that graphics style. |
|  | [IsFaceSetOpen](0da2193e-aebc-5eb4-353e-ea72a12868bc.md) | Flag whether the current set of connected faces is open and additional tessellation faces can be added to it. |
|  | [IsValidObject](6a5c7474-6ea6-4886-d356-204405406596.md) | Specifies whether the .NET object represents a valid Revit entity.  (Inherited from [ShapeBuilder](66c1678c-2e01-e0de-1386-5a0e1eb3ccff.md).) |
|  | [LogInteger](c6a84d2a-824d-07e9-4559-79bb80d25e8e.md) | Integer value used for logging, if it is performed. Usually the number of the face set(s) in the IFC file, from which they are imported. Any value is acceptable. |
|  | [LogString](dbfa746b-807f-d58a-cd1c-67ff07f4b968.md) | String used for logging, if any. Usually the name of the file from which face sets were imported. |
|  | [NumberOfCompletedFaceSets](aacc351c-0e65-7d1d-c177-627de5e9974a.md) | Number of completed face sets. |
|  | [OwnerInfo](5c2c3e95-ae6e-f303-a770-662acf186181.md) | String used for logging, if any. Usually describes the element or object, which either defined or will own the geoemtrical objects to be built. |
|  | [Target](2e6f38a0-cabd-5fac-34dc-40af993135c7.md) | Requests the type of geometry to be built. |
