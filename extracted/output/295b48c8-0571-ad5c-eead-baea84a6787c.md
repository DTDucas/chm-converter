# Remarks

This class represents a document opened in the user interface and therefore offers interfaces to work with settings and operations in the UI (for example, the active selection). Revit can have multiple projects open and multiple views to those projects. The active or top most view will be the active project and hence the active document which is available from the UIApplication object.

Obtain the database level Document (which contains interfaces not related to the UI) via the Document property. If you have a database level Document and need to access it from the UI, you can construct a new UIDocument from that object (the document must be open and visible in the UI to allow the methods to work successfully).
