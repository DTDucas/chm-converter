# Properties

|  | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | [CategoryType](e04b3dca-a39a-80f6-cd2d-970a2d53accf.md) | The category type which this layer belongs to. |
|  | [ColorName](340ddf1d-6b6b-9dc5-b810-adc49fd7e588.md) | The color name stored in value. For IFC export, the naming is to match the "colornumber" setting -- really, this stores a string that generates the colorNumber (for formats that don't use the color but need a second entry.) |
|  | [ColorNumber](b4573c4c-4fbf-4cae-9daa-56ae56238c7a.md) | The color number stored in value. |
|  | [CutColorNumber](709b3f69-aa51-7c21-e59f-7b862ab27687.md) | The cut color number stored in value. |
|  | [CutLayerName](b9a4b8a6-0905-9406-e825-ee5b1b0fe2c9.md) | The cut layer name stored in value. |
|  | [IsValidObject](d00d4127-b409-ba78-c78e-b5a272548217.md) | Specifies whether the .NET object represents a valid Revit entity. |
|  | [LayerName](6b2cbbf8-6f6f-d06a-2b44-2dd34247f410.md) | The layer name stored in value. |
