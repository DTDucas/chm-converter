The [TessellatedShapeBuilder](a144b0e3-c997-eac1-5c00-51c56d9e66f2.md) type exposes the following members.

# Methods

|  | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | [AddFace](401c4066-4ec1-be8c-53ae-daea44f3244d.md) | Adds a face to the currently open connected face set. |
|  | [AreTargetAndFallbackCompatible](fc565805-bda1-2cd3-6bf0-e0defa4edfc9.md) | Checks whether this combination of fallback and target parameters can be used as a valid combination of inputs. |
|  | [Build](3b67078d-f8fd-83f4-ee2e-b83e8ec23a23.md) | Builds the designated geometrical objects from the stored face sets. Stores the result in this TessellatedShapeBuilder object. |
|  | [CancelConnectedFaceSet](11a71aab-1685-27ad-10c4-328e4a02b4fb.md) | Cancels the current face set - i.e., all data from it will be lost and the builder will have no open connected face set anymore. |
|  | [Clear](8c2cd942-f8c3-3288-bac6-8d4d1f064714.md) | Erases all face set and clears the logs, if any. |
|  | [CloseConnectedFaceSet](0bebb71c-317e-3dbc-1304-169561e22214.md) | Closes the currently open connected face set. |
|  | [CreateMeshByExtrusion](16bfff9e-b581-94b8-4797-cb880d79e793.md) | Builds a mesh by extruding curve loop(s) along extrusion distance. |
|  | [Dispose](efbfadf8-519d-7f66-8553-e887ed3058f1.md) | (Inherited from [ShapeBuilder](66c1678c-2e01-e0de-1386-5a0e1eb3ccff.md).) |
|  | [DoesFaceHaveEnoughLoopsAndVertices](894594d4-e75a-843e-ed5f-c9554feec2f4.md) | Checks whether 'face' has enough loops and vertcies to be valid. |
|  | Equals | Determines whether the specified Object is equal to the current Object. (Inherited from Object.) |
|  | [GetBuildResult](136e8763-4156-4ffe-0fcc-45af9dbb6c14.md) | Get the built geometry, build status and other data stored in TessellatedShapeBuilderResult. Clears the stored data. |
|  | GetHashCode | Serves as a hash function for a particular type.  (Inherited from Object.) |
|  | GetType | Gets the Type of the current instance. (Inherited from Object.) |
|  | [OpenConnectedFaceSet](186da29a-caa2-99ea-1b2a-722c1656c44a.md) | Opens a new connected face set. |
|  | ToString | Returns a string that represents the current object. (Inherited from Object.) |
