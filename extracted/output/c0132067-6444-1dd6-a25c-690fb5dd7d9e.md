[Members](2d692135-d5a7-0672-5f88-b93196aa42a5.md "SpatialElementGeometryCalculator Members") Example See Also  
---  
Use this class to calculate the geometry of a spatial element and obtain the relationships between the geometry and the element's boundary elements. 
**Namespace:** [Autodesk.Revit.DB](87546ba7-461b-c646-cbb1-2cb8f5bff8b2.md "Autodesk.Revit.DB Namespace")**Assembly:** RevitAPI (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 24.0.0.0 (24.0.0.0)**Since:** 2012

# Remarks
This class maintains an internal cache for geometry it has already processed. If you intend to calculate geometry for several elements in the same project you should use a single instance of this class. Note that the cache will be cleared when any change is made to the document. 
# Examples
CopyC#
```text
// Calculate a room's geometry and find its boundary faces
SpatialElementGeometryCalculator calculator = new SpatialElementGeometryCalculator(doc);
SpatialElementGeometryResults results = calculator.CalculateSpatialElementGeometry(room); // compute the room geometry 
Solid roomSolid = results.GetGeometry(); // get the solid representing the room's geometry
foreach (Face face in roomSolid.Faces)
{
    double faceArea = face.Area;
    IList<SpatialElementBoundarySubface> subfaceList = results.GetBoundaryFaceInfo(face); // get the sub-faces for the face of the room
    foreach (SpatialElementBoundarySubface subface in subfaceList)
    {
        if (subfaceList.Count > 1) // there are multiple sub-faces that define the face
        {
            double subfaceArea = subface.GetSubface().Area; // get the area of each sub-face
            // sub-faces exist in situations such as when a room-bounding wall has been
            // horizontally split and the faces of each split wall combine to create the 
            // entire face of the room
        }
    }
}
```
