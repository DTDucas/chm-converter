Use this class to calculate the geometry of a spatial element and obtain the relationships between the geometry and the element's boundary elements. 

**Namespace:** [Autodesk.Revit.DB](87546ba7-461b-c646-cbb1-2cb8f5bff8b2.md)**Assembly:** RevitAPI (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 24.0.0.0 (24.0.0.0)**Since:** 2012

# Remarks

This class maintains an internal cache for geometry it has already processed. If you intend to calculate geometry for several elements in the same project you should use a single instance of this class. Note that the cache will be cleared when any change is made to the document. 

# Examples

CopyC#
    
    
    // Calculate a room's geometry and find its boundary faces
    SpatialElementGeometryCalculator calculator = new SpatialElementGeometryCalculator(doc);
    SpatialElementGeometryResults results = calculator.CalculateSpatialElementGeometry(room); // compute the room geometry 
    Solid roomSolid = results.GetGeometry(); // get the solid representing the room's geometry
    foreach (Face face in roomSolid.Faces)
    {
        double faceArea = face.Area;
        IList<SpatialElementBoundarySubface> subfaceList = results.GetBoundaryFaceInfo(face); // get the sub-faces for the face of the room
        foreach (SpatialElementBoundarySubface subface in subfaceList)
        {
            if (subfaceList.Count > 1) // there are multiple sub-faces that define the face
            {
                double subfaceArea = subface.GetSubface().Area; // get the area of each sub-face
                // sub-faces exist in situations such as when a room-bounding wall has been
                // horizontally split and the faces of each split wall combine to create the 
                // entire face of the room
            }
        }
    }
