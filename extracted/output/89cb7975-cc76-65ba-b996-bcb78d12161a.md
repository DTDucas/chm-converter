#### Parameters

solid0
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..Solid](7a3b5ac1-c66d-9f81-a11d-9bcd4e026295.md) The first solid object. A copy will be taken of the input object, so any solid whether obtained from a Revit element or not would be accepted. 

solid1
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..Solid](7a3b5ac1-c66d-9f81-a11d-9bcd4e026295.md) The second solid object. A copy will be taken of the input object, so any solid whether obtained from a Revit element or not would be accepted. 

booleanType
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..BooleanOperationsType](46aeb9cd-4b44-0dcf-6f78-469c1271f5d4.md) boolean operation type. 

#### Return Value

The result geometry. 

# Examples

CopyC#
    
    
    private void ComputeIntersectionVolume(Solid solidA, Solid solidB)
    {
        Solid intersection = BooleanOperationsUtils.ExecuteBooleanOperation(solidA, solidB, BooleanOperationsType.Intersect);
        double volumeOfIntersection = intersection.Volume;
    }

CopyVB.NET
    
    
    Private Sub ComputeIntersectionVolume(solidA As Solid, solidB As Solid)
        Dim intersection As Solid = BooleanOperationsUtils.ExecuteBooleanOperation(solidA, solidB, BooleanOperationsType.Intersect)
        Dim volumeOfIntersection As Double = intersection.Volume
    End Sub

# Exceptions

| Exception | Condition |
| --- | --- |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions..::..ArgumentNullException](631e1424-60f4-929b-4e52-dda9dcd26316.md) | A non-optional argument was null |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions..::..ArgumentOutOfRangeException](60f148c9-ece0-a6bb-4e12-bb4a9c8c8a24.md) | A value passed for an enumeration argument is not a member of that enumeration |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions..::..InvalidOperationException](9e715f03-3884-e539-4dd6-8d7545733adc.md) | Failed to perform the Boolean operation for the two solids. This may be due to geometric inaccuracies in the solids, such as slightly misaligned faces or edges. If so, eliminating the inaccuracies by making sure the solids are accurately aligned may solve the problem. This also may be due to one or both solids having complexities such as more than two faces geometrically meeting along a single edge, or two coincident edges, etc. Eliminating such conditions, or performing a sequence of Boolean operations in an order that avoids such conditions, may solve the problem. |
