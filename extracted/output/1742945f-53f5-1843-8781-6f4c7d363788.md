#### Return Value

The model space to view projection space transformation. 

# Remarks

The transform can be used to transform points from model space to view projection space.

Model space is the global 3D coordinate space in which the 3D geometry of the model lives.

View projection space is the 3D Euclidean space with a coordinate system such that X and Y are horizontal and vertical directions in the view projection plane and Z is the cross product of X and Y. Distances in the projection space are the same as would be measured on paper if the view is printed without additional scaling.

For uncropped views all model space points can be transformed to projection space using the this transform. 

For cropped views only model points which lie inside the boundary returned by [GetBoundary()()()()](5f38a440-a539-f5b0-2b48-1aefb8bf03a4.md) should be transformed to projection space using this transform.
