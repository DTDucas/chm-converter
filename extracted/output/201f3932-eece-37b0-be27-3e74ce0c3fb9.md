# Remarks

Only reporting parameters can be driven by dimensions. Thus, to drive a parameter by a dimension, the parameter must first be set as reporting before it is used to label the driving dimension.

Note that the value of this property is always the opposite of the [IsDrivenByFormula](ee9c7baa-47b9-f84d-c2e2-103711fbb756.md) property. It is so because a parameter of which value is evaluated by a formula cannot be driven by a dimension, and vice versa.
