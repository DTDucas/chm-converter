| Midpoint | Leaders are aligned vertically with the midpoint of the text box and their shoulder line always ends at the box' border regardless of whether the border is visible on not. |
| BottomLine | Leaders are attached at the position of the bottom (last) line of the text box, and, unless the text's border is visible, the leader's shoulder line extends all the way to the text, minus the current value of text border offset. |
