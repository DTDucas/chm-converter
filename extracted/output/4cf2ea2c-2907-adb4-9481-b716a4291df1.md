The [Plane](6a6ee978-f114-558d-3c69-00d289aa855f.md) type exposes the following members.

# Methods

|  | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | [Create](38aeacdd-59c5-7741-2802-6de25838130f.md) | Creates a Plane object defined by a local frame of reference. |
|  | [CreateByNormalAndOrigin](ab735815-f6bc-aae1-8afc-8505bba18cb5.md) | Constructs a Plane object from a normal and an origin represented as XYZ objects. Follows the standard conventions for a planar surface. The constructed Plane object will pass through origin and be perpendicular to normal. The X and Y axes of the plane will be defined arbitrarily. |
|  | [CreateByOriginAndBasis](425db4fe-1368-0a48-6fb0-9c458035ea6a.md) | Creates a Plane object defined by the two orthogonal unit vectors and passing through the origin point supplied as arguments. |
|  | [CreateByThreePoints](a18aa7a2-71b6-5fa2-8ca8-abadedb638d7.md) | Creates a Plane object passing through three points supplied as arguments. |
|  | [Dispose](c9ee1344-bc19-d833-52e7-dcc4931fe085.md) | (Inherited from [Surface](bb391358-5ca0-578d-e8e2-6d1b30c472d8.md).) |
|  | Equals | Determines whether the specified Object is equal to the current Object. (Inherited from Object.) |
|  | [GetBoundingBoxUV](5084214f-219f-780f-fe03-f16b62b2660d.md) | Gets the UV bounding box of the surface.  (Inherited from [Surface](bb391358-5ca0-578d-e8e2-6d1b30c472d8.md).) |
|  | GetHashCode | Serves as a hash function for a particular type.  (Inherited from Object.) |
|  | GetType | Gets the Type of the current instance. (Inherited from Object.) |
|  | [Project](802cc09b-d0a4-dfc5-8ca1-e8c5e8cd4ced.md) | Project a 3D point orthogonally onto a surface (to find the nearest point). Throws InvalidOperationException if the projection fails.  (Inherited from [Surface](bb391358-5ca0-578d-e8e2-6d1b30c472d8.md).) |
|  | [ProjectWithGuessPoint](db8cc42a-9f34-611a-d9c5-852f3935887f.md) | Project a 3D point orthogonally onto a surface (to find the nearest point). This method is meant to be used when a good approximate solution for the projection is available. Throws InvalidOperationException if the projection fails.  (Inherited from [Surface](bb391358-5ca0-578d-e8e2-6d1b30c472d8.md).) |
|  | ToString | Returns a string that represents the current object. (Inherited from Object.) |
