# ### Parameters
document
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..Document](db03274b-a107-aa32-9034-f3e0df4bb1ec.md "Document Class") The document. 
ductTypeId
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..ElementId](44f3f7b1-3229-3404-93c9-dc5e70337dd6.md "ElementId Class") The ElementId of the new duct type. 
levelId
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..ElementId](44f3f7b1-3229-3404-93c9-dc5e70337dd6.md "ElementId Class") The level ElementId for the new duct. 
startConnector
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..Connector](11e07082-b3f2-26a1-de79-16535f44716c.md "Connector Class") The first connector where the new duct starts. 
endConnector
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..Connector](11e07082-b3f2-26a1-de79-16535f44716c.md "Connector Class") The second point of the new duct. 
# ### Return Value
The created duct. 
# Remarks
The new duct will have the same diameter and system type as the start connector. The creation will also connect the new duct to two component who owns the specified connectors. If necessary, additional fitting(s) are included to make a valid connection. If the new duct can not be connected to the next component (e.g., mismatched direction, no valid fitting, and etc), the new duct will still be created at the specified connector position, and an InvalidOperationException is thrown.
