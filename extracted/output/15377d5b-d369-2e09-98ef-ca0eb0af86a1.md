#### Parameters

point
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..UV](1724be37-059b-91ff-aa74-d1508082f76d.md)The parameters to be evaluated, in natural parameterization of the face.

#### Return Value

The normal vector. This vector will be normalized.

# Remarks

Differs from the normal returned from [ComputeDerivatives(UV)](77ca18ef-783e-9db5-a37a-2d76f637d1a1.md) in that this vector is the "face normal" vector. It will always be oriented to point out of a solid that contains the face.
