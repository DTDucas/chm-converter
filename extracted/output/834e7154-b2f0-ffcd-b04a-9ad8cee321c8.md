#### Parameters

document
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..Document](db03274b-a107-aa32-9034-f3e0df4bb1ec.md) The document to which the new detail ViewSection will be added. 

viewFamilyTypeId
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..ElementId](44f3f7b1-3229-3404-93c9-dc5e70337dd6.md) The id of the ViewFamilyType which will be used by the new detail ViewSection. The type needs to be a Detail ViewFamily. 

sectionBox
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..BoundingBoxXYZ](3c452286-57b1-40e2-2795-c90bff1fcec2.md) The BoundingBoxXYZ which specifies the new ViewSection's view direction and extents. 

#### Return Value

The new detail ViewSection. 

# Remarks

Create a detail ViewSection whose view volume corresponds geometrically with the specified sectionBox. The view direction of the resulting section will be sectionBox.Transform.BasisZ and the up direction will be sectionBox.Transform.BasisY. The right hand direction will be computed so that (right, up, view direction) form a left handed coordinate system. The resulting view will be cropped, and far clipping will be active. The crop region will correspond to the projections of BoundingBoxXYZ.Min and BoundingBoxXYZ.Max onto the view's cut plane. The far clip distance will be equal to the difference of the z-coordinates of BoundingBoxXYZ.Min and BoundingBoxXYZ.Max. The new detail ViewSection will receive a unique view name. 

# Examples

CopyC#
    
    
    // Get a BoundingBoxXYZ instance from Revit
    BoundingBoxXYZ box = document.ActiveView.CropBox;
    if (null == box)
    {
        throw new Exception("No BoundingBoxXYZ instance found.");
    }
    
    // Create a new view section.
    ElementId DetailViewId = ElementId.InvalidElementId;
    IList<Element> elems = new FilteredElementCollector(document).OfClass(typeof(ViewFamilyType)).ToElements();
    foreach (Element e in elems)
    {
        ViewFamilyType v = e as ViewFamilyType;
    
        if (v != null && v.ViewFamily == ViewFamily.Detail)
        {
            DetailViewId = e.Id;
            break;
        }
    }
    ViewSection viewSection = ViewSection.CreateDetail(document, DetailViewId, box);

CopyVB.NET
    
    
    ' Get a BoundingBoxXYZ instance from Revit
    Dim box As BoundingBoxXYZ = document.ActiveView.CropBox
    If box Is Nothing Then
        Throw New Exception("No BoundingBoxXYZ instance found.")
    End If
    
    ' Create a new view section.
    Dim DetailViewId As ElementId = ElementId.InvalidElementId
    Dim elems As IList(Of Element) = New FilteredElementCollector(document).OfClass(GetType(ViewFamilyType)).ToElements()
    For Each e As Element In elems
        Dim v As ViewFamilyType = TryCast(e, ViewFamilyType)
    
        If v IsNot Nothing AndAlso v.ViewFamily = ViewFamily.Detail Then
            DetailViewId = e.Id
            Exit For
        End If
    Next
    Dim viewSection__1 As ViewSection = ViewSection.CreateDetail(document, DetailViewId, box)
