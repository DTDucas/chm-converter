Gets the hook orientation angle that is applied to this Rebar at the bar with index barPositionIndex at the specified end. 

**Namespace:** [Autodesk.Revit.DB.Structure](d586b341-f687-9d90-e96d-255806b7d4fc.md)**Assembly:** RevitAPI (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 24.0.0.0 (24.0.0.0)**Since:** 2019 

# Syntax

    public double GetHookOrientationAngleAtIndex(
    	int barPositionIndex,
    	int end
    )  
  
Visual Basic  
---  
      
    
    Public Function GetHookOrientationAngleAtIndex ( _
    	barPositionIndex As Integer, _
    	end As Integer _
    ) As Double

    public:
    double GetHookOrientationAngleAtIndex(
    	int barPositionIndex, 
    	int end
    )  
  
#### Parameters

barPositionIndex
    Type: System..::..Int32 An index between 0 and (NumberOfBarPositions-1). 

end
    Type: System..::..Int32 0 for the start hook, 1 for the end hook. 

#### Return Value

Returns the hook orientation angle at the specified end. 

# Remarks

If this Rebar has Workshop Instructions set to Straight will return the same value for all barPositionIndex between 0 and (NumberOfBarPositions-1). This value will be the same as RebarFreeFormAccessor.GetHookOrientationAngle(int end).

If this Rebar has Workshop Instructions set to Bent there are different cases: 

  * All bars are matched exactly with a shape. In this case will return the same value for all barPositionIndex between 0 and (NumberOfBarPositions-1). This value will be the same as RebarFreeFormAccessor.GetHookOrientationAngle(int end).
  * All bars are matched in reversed order with a shape. In this case will return the same value for all barPositionIndex between 0 and (NumberOfBarPositions-1). This value will be the same as RebarFreeFormAccessor.GetHookOrientationAngle(int end).
  * Some bars are matched in reversed order and the others are matched exactly with a shape. In this case for bars that are matched reversed will return the hook orientation angle at the opposite end. For the others bars will return the same as RebarFreeFormAccessor.GetHookOrientationAngle(int end).
