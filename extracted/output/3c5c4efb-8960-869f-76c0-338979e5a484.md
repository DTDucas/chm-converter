# Syntax

```text
public IList<GeometryObject> GetGeometricalObjects()
```
  
Visual Basic

public:
IList<GeometryObject^>^ GetGeometricalObjects()
```
  
# ### Return Value
Geometrical object which were built. 
# Remarks
Normally an array contains a single geometrical object corresponding to either 'target' or 'fallback' type', but if multiple face sets are being built with target/fallback of "AnyGeometry/Mesh", then a two-element array with both geometry as the 1st element and mesh as the 2nd can be returned. It happens if some of the face sets require a fallback processing and some do not.
