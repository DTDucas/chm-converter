When called the first time, returns geometrical objects which were built. Later calls will throw exceptions.

    IList<[GeometryObject](e0f15010-0e19-6216-e2f0-ab7978145daa.md)^>^ GetGeometricalObjects()  
  
#### Return Value

Geometrical object which were built. 

# Remarks

Normally an array contains a single geometrical object corresponding to either 'target' or 'fallback' type', but if multiple face sets are being built with target/fallback of "AnyGeometry/Mesh", then a two-element array with both geometry as the 1st element and mesh as the 2nd can be returned. It happens if some of the face sets require a fallback processing and some do not.
