    public:
    property [SelectionFilterAction](c78f7e32-a50e-d092-c8c5-6371464a747c.md) FilterAction {
    	[SelectionFilterAction](c78f7e32-a50e-d092-c8c5-6371464a747c.md) get ();
    	void set ([SelectionFilterAction](c78f7e32-a50e-d092-c8c5-6371464a747c.md) value);
    }  
  
# Remarks

If no selection filter is applied, changing this value will have no visible effect. The filter is provided in the coordinates of the Revit model. If the point cloud is altered (e.g. by moving, rotating, scaling or other modifications) the point cloud filter is not modified and the set of highlighted or isolated points will change. The filter action is not preserved when the Revit document is saved.
