#### Parameters

node
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..FaceSilhouetteNode](7f6dab2d-6285-1027-9b4a-39d773002442.md) An output node that represents a Face silhouette. 

#### Return Value

Return RenderNodeAction.Proceed if you wish to receive tessellated geometry (line or polyline segments) for this face silhouette, or otherwise return RenderNodeAction.Skip. 

Note: if the export is performed for the view in non-Wireframe display style tesselated geometry will be output regardless of the return value.

# Remarks

Note that this method is invoked only if the custom exporter was set up to include geometric objects in the output stream. See [IncludeGeometricObjects](2ce1075e-380e-01e7-6459-b7467c2a2414.md) for mode details.

Note: if the export is performed for the view in non-Wireframe display style this method will be called regardless of whether the object will be eventially output, i.e. even if it's occluded by another element.
