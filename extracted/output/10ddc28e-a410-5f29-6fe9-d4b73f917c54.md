Rebar..::..CreateFromCurvesAndShape Method (Document, RebarShape, RebarBarType, RebarHookType, RebarHookType, Element, XYZ, IList<(Of <(<'Curve>)>)>, RebarHookOrientation, RebarHookOrientation)  
[Rebar Class](70fd7426-f4a4-591c-8c06-3c18dda45e7d.md "Rebar Class") See Also  
---  
Creates a new instance of a shape driven Rebar element within the project. The instance will have the default shape parameters from the RebarShape. If the RebarShapeDefinesHooks flag in ReinforcementSettings has been set to true, then both the curves and hooks must match the RebarShape definition. Otherwise, the hooks can be different than the defaults specified in the RebarShape

# ### Parameters
doc
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..Document](db03274b-a107-aa32-9034-f3e0df4bb1ec.md "Document Class") A document. 
rebarShape
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB.Structure..::..RebarShape](0a370e32-eaba-785e-7e1f-9330929525fc.md "RebarShape Class") A RebarShape element that defines the shape of the rebar. A RebarShape element matches curves and hooks. A RebarShape element provides RebarStyle of the rebar. 
barType
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB.Structure..::..RebarBarType](467b44cc-54e7-3ecf-07e1-ad15d05fe800.md "RebarBarType Class") A RebarBarType element that defines bar diameter, bend radius and material of the rebar. 
startHook
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB.Structure..::..RebarHookType](3c7a78d5-f92b-e58b-e7c9-7927537498fd.md "RebarHookType Class") A RebarHookType element that defines the hook for the start of the bar. If this parameter is nullNothingnullptra null reference (Nothing in Visual Basic), it means to create a rebar with no hook. 
endHook
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB.Structure..::..RebarHookType](3c7a78d5-f92b-e58b-e7c9-7927537498fd.md "RebarHookType Class") A RebarHookType element that defines the hook for the end of the bar. If this parameter is nullNothingnullptra null reference (Nothing in Visual Basic), it means to create a rebar with no hook. 
host
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..Element](eb16114f-69ea-f4de-0d0d-f7388b105a16.md "Element Class") The element to which the rebar belongs. The element must support rebar hosting; [!:Autodesk::Revit::DB::Structure::RebarHostData]. 
norm
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..XYZ](c2fd995c-95c0-58fb-f5de-f3246cbc5600.md "XYZ Class") The normal to the plane that the rebar curves lie on. 
curves
    Type: System.Collections.Generic..::..IList<(Of <(<'[Curve](400cc9b6-9ff7-de85-6fd8-c20002209d25.md "Curve Class")>)>)> An array of curves that define the shape of the rebar curves. They must belong to the plane defined by the normal and origin. Bends and hooks should not be included in the array of curves. 
startHookOrient
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB.Structure..::..RebarHookOrientation](e8365754-0811-8d4e-864a-55bf34af3a87.md "RebarHookOrientation Enumeration") Defines the orientation of the hook plane at the start of the rebar with respect to the orientation of the first curve and the plane normal. Only two values are permitted: Value = Right: The hook is on your right as you stand at the end of the bar, with the bar behind you, taking the bar's normal as "up." Value = Left: The hook is on your left as you stand at the end of the bar, with the bar behind you, taking the bar's normal as "up." 
endHookOrient
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB.Structure..::..RebarHookOrientation](e8365754-0811-8d4e-864a-55bf34af3a87.md "RebarHookOrientation Enumeration") Defines the orientation of the hook plane at the end of the rebar with respect to the orientation of the last curve and the plane normal. Only two values are permitted: Value = Right: The hook is on your right as you stand at the end of the bar, with the bar behind you, taking the bar's normal as "up." Value = Left: The hook is on your left as you stand at the end of the bar, with the bar behind you, taking the bar's normal as "up." 
# ### Return Value
The newly created Rebar instance, or nullNothingnullptra null reference (Nothing in Visual Basic) if the operation fails.
