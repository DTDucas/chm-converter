**Namespace:** [Autodesk.Revit.DB](87546ba7-461b-c646-cbb1-2cb8f5bff8b2.md)**Assembly:** RevitAPI (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 24.0.0.0 (24.0.0.0)

# Syntax

C#  
---  
      
    
    public bool DeleteLayer(
    	int layerIdx
    )  
  
Visual Basic  
---  
      
    
    Public Function DeleteLayer ( _
    	layerIdx As Integer _
    ) As Boolean  
  
Visual C++  
---  
      
    
    public:
    bool DeleteLayer(
    	int layerIdx
    )  
  
#### Parameters

layerIdx
    Type: System..::..Int32 The layer index is zero based. It counts from the exterior of wall and from the top of roofs, floors and ceilings. 

#### Return Value

True if the layer was successfully deleted, and false otherwise. 

# Remarks

For a vertically compound structure, a layer may only be deleted if it is not associated to a region, or else it is associated to exactly one simple region, which will also be deleted. Regions associated to layers with index greater than layerIdx will have their associated layer indices decremented by one.
