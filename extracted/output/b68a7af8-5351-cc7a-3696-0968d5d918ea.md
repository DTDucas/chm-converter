The [IRebarUpdateServer](3e845cad-eca0-ccb3-785b-48a32a9f2677.md) type exposes the following members.

# Methods

|  | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | [GenerateCurves](2b83cc23-076c-1843-f078-46d0c1f2dc74.md) | This function is supposed to calculate the bars in set based on data received in curvesData parameter. |
|  | [GetCustomHandleName](7f072a66-48c3-43d1-5d3e-a8a5ae787477.md) | This function should return the name of the handle. |
|  | [GetCustomHandles](37833063-e74a-26bb-bdf8-9700f7a446cb.md) | This function should define all handles that the Rebar has. This function is called when the Rebar is created. |
|  | [GetDescription](ab8f162b-c7af-dafc-04f6-8cb3835caa13.md) | Implement this method to return a description of the server.  (Inherited from [IExternalServer](91e4af0b-59c0-d640-107a-eebc4d99fa76.md).) |
|  | [GetHandlesPosition](7f991fe0-6c77-ba43-3d52-64a8c0390809.md) | This function is supposed to provide the positions of handles defined in GetCustomHandles(). These positions will be shown on screen when the bar constraints are edited. If a position for a handle isn't provided, that handle will not be represented on screen while edit constraints.This function is called when edit constraints command is lunched or during edit constraints after a constraint was changed and the curve calculation was done. |
|  | [GetName](df64b529-27e1-3a6a-7876-2145bb8a37b4.md) | Implement this method to return the name of the server.  (Inherited from [IExternalServer](91e4af0b-59c0-d640-107a-eebc4d99fa76.md).) |
|  | [GetServerId](49b1955b-a729-b610-0138-592784d20171.md) | Implement this method to return the id of the server.  (Inherited from [IExternalServer](91e4af0b-59c0-d640-107a-eebc4d99fa76.md).) |
|  | [GetServiceId](1f8da2c8-54d9-2d69-bdcc-e801d990d463.md) | Implement this method to return the id of the service.  (Inherited from [IExternalServer](91e4af0b-59c0-d640-107a-eebc4d99fa76.md).) |
|  | [GetVendorId](76cf499a-4a59-9249-8995-e1ab9e629f37.md) | Implement this method to return the id of the vendor of the server.  (Inherited from [IExternalServer](91e4af0b-59c0-d640-107a-eebc4d99fa76.md).) |
|  | [TrimExtendCurves](6db89b01-28aa-8b95-f3c0-a0f00cdb84c5.md) | This function is supposed to trim or extend curves that were obtained from calling GenerateCurves(). Also in this function can be set new constraints for start and end handles. |
