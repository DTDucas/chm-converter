Determines if this edge's topological direction on the Face is opposite to its parametric direction. 

**Namespace:** [Autodesk.Revit.DB](87546ba7-461b-c646-cbb1-2cb8f5bff8b2.md)**Assembly:** RevitAPI (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 24.0.0.0 (24.0.0.0)**Since:** 2021

# Syntax

C#  
---  
      
    
    public bool IsFlippedOnFace(
    	int index
    )  
  
Visual Basic  
---  
      
    
    Public Function IsFlippedOnFace ( _
    	index As Integer _
    ) As Boolean  
  
Visual C++  
---  
      
    
    public:
    bool IsFlippedOnFace(
    	int index
    )  
  
#### Parameters

index
    Type: System..::..Int32The index of the face (0 or 1).

#### Return Value

true if this edge's topological direction on the Face is opposite to its parametric direction, false if the topological direction agrees with the parametric direction.

# Remarks

Outer edge loops on a Face are oriented counter-clockwise with respect to the Face's orientation, and inner loops are oriented clockwise. The topological direction of an edge on a face means the direction in which the edge's loop is being traversed.
