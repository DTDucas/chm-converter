# Syntax

C#  
---  
      
    
    public bool LoadFamily(
    	string filename,
    	out [Family](f51d019d-6ff3-692b-d1d2-b497cab564de.md) family
    )  
  
Visual Basic  
---  
      
    
    Public Function LoadFamily ( _
    	filename As String, _
    	<OutAttribute> ByRef family As [Family](f51d019d-6ff3-692b-d1d2-b497cab564de.md) _
    ) As Boolean  
  
Visual C++  
---  
      
    
    public:
    bool LoadFamily(
    	String^ filename, 
    	[OutAttribute] [Family](f51d019d-6ff3-692b-d1d2-b497cab564de.md)^% family
    )  
  
#### Parameters

filename
    Type: System..::..StringThe fully qualified filename of the Family file, usually ending in .rfa.

family
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..Family](f51d019d-6ff3-692b-d1d2-b497cab564de.md)%A reference to the family that was loaded if successful, otherwise nullNothingnullptra null reference (Nothing in Visual Basic).

#### Return Value

True if the entire family was loaded successfully into the project, otherwise False.

# Remarks

Loading an entire family may take a considerable amount of time and memory. It is recommended that you use one of the LoadFamilySymbol() methods and only load those symbols that you need. 

# Examples

CopyC#
    
    
    // Get the Revit library path as defined via the Options dialog - File Locations tab - Places button
    string libraryPath = "";
    application.Application.GetLibraryPaths().TryGetValue("Imperial Library", out libraryPath);
    
    if (String.IsNullOrEmpty(libraryPath))
    {
        libraryPath = "c:\\";   // If not have, use a default path.
    }
    
    // Allow the user to select a family file.
    OpenFileDialog openFileDialog1 = new OpenFileDialog();
    openFileDialog1.InitialDirectory = libraryPath;
| openFileDialog1.Filter = "Family Files (*.rfa) | *.rfa"; |
    
    // Load the family file using LoadFamily method and then give information.
    if (DialogResult.OK == openFileDialog1.ShowDialog())
    {
        Autodesk.Revit.DB.Family family = null;
        if (document.LoadFamily(openFileDialog1.FileName, out family))
        {
            String name = family.Name;
            TaskDialog.Show("Revit","Family file has been loaded. Its name is " + name);
        }
        else
        {
            TaskDialog.Show("Revit","Can't load the family file.");
        }
    }

CopyVB.NET

    application.Application.GetLibraryPaths().TryGetValue("Imperial Library", libraryPath)
    
    If [String].IsNullOrEmpty(libraryPath) Then
        ' If not have, use a default path.
        libraryPath = "c:\"
    End If
    
    ' Allow the user to select a family file.
    Dim openFileDialog1 As New OpenFileDialog()
    openFileDialog1.InitialDirectory = libraryPath
| openFileDialog1.Filter = "Family Files (*.rfa) | *.rfa" |
    
    ' Load the family file using LoadFamily method and then give information.
    If DialogResult.OK = openFileDialog1.ShowDialog() Then
        Dim family As Autodesk.Revit.DB.Family = Nothing
        If document.LoadFamily(openFileDialog1.FileName, family) Then
            Dim name As [String] = family.Name
            TaskDialog.Show("Revit", "Family file has been loaded. Its name is " & name)
