**Namespace:** [Autodesk.Revit.DB](87546ba7-461b-c646-cbb1-2cb8f5bff8b2.md)**Assembly:** RevitAPI (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 24.0.0.0 (24.0.0.0)**Since:** 2016 

# Syntax

C#  
---  
      
    
    public void ConvertToIndependent()  
  
Visual Basic  
---  
      
    
    Public Sub ConvertToIndependent  
  
Visual C++  
---  
      
    
    public:
    void ConvertToIndependent()  
  
# Remarks

This method can be only applied to a dependent view. A dependent view can be created from another view using method View.Duplicate(ViewDuplicateOption.AsDependent). Dependent views have a valid primary view element ID that can be obtained via method View.GetPrimaryViewId(); Independent views have InvalidElementId as their primary view ID. 

# Examples

CopyC#
    
    
    public void MakeViewIndependent(View view)
    {
        // Independent views will have an InvalidElementId for the Primary View Id
        if (view.GetPrimaryViewId() != ElementId.InvalidElementId)
        {
            view.ConvertToIndependent();
        }
    }

CopyVB.NET
    
    
    Public Sub MakeViewIndependent(view As View)
        ' Independent views will have an InvalidElementId for the Primary View Id
        If view.GetPrimaryViewId() <> ElementId.InvalidElementId Then
            view.ConvertToIndependent()
        End If
    End Sub
