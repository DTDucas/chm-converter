#### Parameters

DBView
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..View](fb92a4e7-f3a7-ef14-e631-342179b18de9.md) The floor plan view to use when computing the shortest distance. 

pathStarts
    Type: System.Collections.Generic..::..IList<(Of <(<'[XYZ](c2fd995c-95c0-58fb-f5de-f3246cbc5600.md)>)>)> The start points of the path. The input Z coordinates are ignored and set to the view's level elevation. 

pathEnds
    Type: System.Collections.Generic..::..IList<(Of <(<'[XYZ](c2fd995c-95c0-58fb-f5de-f3246cbc5600.md)>)>)> The end points of the path. The input Z coordinates are ignored and set to the view's level elevation. 

#### Return Value

The array of newly created path of travel elements, or nullNothingnullptra null reference (Nothing in Visual Basic) if no path between the two points is found. The order of elements corresponds to the order of start/end points in the argument arrays. There are some additional conditions that are checked and if any condition is true the nullNothingnullptra null reference (Nothing in Visual Basic) value is returned: 

  * View has crop box active and start or end point lies outside of the crop 
  * Start and end points are too close 



# Remarks

InvalidOperationException is thrown if PathOfTravel cannot be created for the following conditions: 

  * View has crop box active and crop box is split 
  * View model outline area is larger than the current limit (2,000,000 sq.ft.) 
  * View export contains too much geometry (more than 200,000 lines) 

ArgumentException exception is thrown if arrays of start and end points are of different size or if the total number of paths of travel attempted to be created is more than maximum allowed (50000).
