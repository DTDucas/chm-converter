|  | [CannotSplitOldMullions](3a555f5f-3a8d-ab45-395e-8bdd8a5d40e8.md) | Split does not work on curtain walls containing mullions created in Revit prior to version 4.0. You may delete the mullions, place them again, and then proceed with splitting the wall. |

|  | [CurtainSystemHostInvisible](709d37cc-3a03-7acd-26cd-9906ae318371.md) | Element defining the Curtain System is invisible in the current view. |
|  | [DanglingCurtainWallCorner](e891b828-d356-7b55-3725-9d6799287771.md) | A Corner Mullion has been placed at the end of a Curtain Wall that is not joined to another Curtain Wall. The angle of the Corner Mullion will default to 90 degrees. |
|  | [DeletingCurtainSystemFaceGridLines](ae8245be-b61e-49e5-18da-5817928c5e30.md) | Deleting Grid Lines residing on faces that no longer are part of a Curtain System. |
|  | [DependentGridlineMayBeDeleted](17799f50-6032-1bd2-add8-f526a8959102.md) | Type generated gridlines will become non-associated due to changes in the type. Press delete if you wish to remove them instead. |
|  | [ExceedMaxDrivenGridlines](bdf311ea-38d9-7543-0f80-7bef44da4e91.md) | Changes have been made that cause a curtain wall with type driven grid lines to exceed the maximum allowed number of type driven lines (200 in direction (1) and 200 in direction (2)). If you really need this many type driven grid lines, please split the affected wall before proceeding. |
|  | [ExessiveBeltDistance](8b20a18b-a810-6fc8-afd5-f35b650dc3fa.md) | The requested Measurement Line Offset would place the put the Measurement Line of the face boundaries. |
|  | [GridlinesOutOfBounds](1f9d6bc6-5a36-52d8-23b9-f24ed897613f.md) | Manually placed curtain grid lines are on the wall edges or outside the wall boundaries. |
|  | [GridlinesOutOfBoundsWarn](04122bd2-195a-44b4-4e2f-e3ff6bc99984.md) | Manually placed curtain grid lines are on the wall edges or outside the wall boundaries. |
|  | [GridlinesOutsideWillBeRedependent](d9e1e49b-89ee-d0c8-8036-43d5e43138d8.md) | Type associated curtain grid lines outside of the edited wall boundaries will be made dependent again in order that they remain on the wall. |
|  | [GridlinesOverlap](ce1d3f12-bc14-ed2f-262b-8021e9522432.md) | Overlapping gridlines should be avoided, unless there are only two and one is host type dependent and the other is not. |
|  | [GridlinesWerePushed](4e085ac4-4e7e-072c-b9ef-52a07fc9ec7c.md) | Panels and mullions created by a curtain grid were created with slight inaccuracies. |
|  | [GridOutOfOrder](0bbd2076-5980-acff-0a17-eb4c0bcf203d.md) | Curtain wall grid lines have changed order. |
|  | [GridOutOfOrderError](2ea2531d-dfd0-a899-9aa8-6426e3c7f928.md) | Curtain wall grid lines have changed order. |
|  | [GridOutsideWall](06c715b9-3ce6-d927-56e2-548ef0c34762.md) | Curtain wall grid lines are outside wall. If you are trying to shorten the wall, please remove grid lines, including mullions on top of them. |
|  | [InvalidSkipSegments](ef0a2495-3ca7-aae9-b637-33e6701c974d.md) | A curtain grid line had invalid removed segment data. When correcting data, Revit may have split curtain panels that should be combined. |
|  | [MullionLostRefReorder](6bead2ba-5e80-27e3-efa9-150c84a6cea1.md) | Mullions have lost references as a result of gridlines changing order. These mullions must be deleted. |
|  | [MullionsWillBeDeleted](e4a9c6af-46bc-3bec-6b9c-d62d077cb51e.md) | The Mullions between the Panels being joined will be deleted. |
|  | [MultipleDominatingMullions](3fa90830-f434-d5f7-caea-55ad8583fb0c.md) | Multiple dominating mullions on a grid face may cause ambiguous automatic adjustment of margins. |
|  | [MultipleIdsInCurtainSystem](be6e2c31-7b9c-5487-0e7d-8323dcc7e030.md) | A Curtain System cannot be based on faces from multiple elements. |
|  | [MustReplacePanels](0a94dad4-55d7-fa94-45df-022ce30b9805.md) | Missing Curtain Panels will be replaced with System Panels to complete command. |

|  | [NonSupportedCurtainWall](e2ac28bf-79ee-4b86-161f-dc98413ad32e.md) | Currently, only straight Walls with straight or arc edges are supported for non-rectangular Curtain Walls. |
|  | [NoPanelsLoaded](4ab0805f-998b-2f5f-1ee0-011f71a27d62.md) | No Curtain Panel Families loaded. Can't make arced Curtain Wall. |
|  | [RequestOrphanMullionDeletion](cd1f2826-b53e-3af7-1623-4c6e4ceb5776.md) | Due to the changes in parameters of their hosts some mullions became non-type driven. |
|  | [RuledCurtainElementLostCurves](6ae248fa-e4d9-3c59-8499-ac7a342c11dc.md) | Ruled Curtain System cannot be built. The Lines or Edges used to create it cannot be found. |
