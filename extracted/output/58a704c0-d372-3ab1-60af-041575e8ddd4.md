#### Parameters

document
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..Document](db03274b-a107-aa32-9034-f3e0df4bb1ec.md)

# Remarks

After unsetting the active server, the document will be using the application-wide active server, if one was already set. 

Note it is not possible to unset a server that acts as an application-wide active server for a service. On the other hand, there should be no reason to ever do so, for each and every registered service should have (ideally) an active server set applicatiton-wide. 

For a service which has cref="Autodesk::Revit::DB::ExternalService::SupportActivation" set to false calling this method will throw exception. For this kind of service only one server can be added, and it will be marked by default as an application-wide active server. 

# Exceptions
