# Constructors

|  | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | [BoundingBoxContainsPointFilter(XYZ)](b4c1d4ae-613f-979d-65d8-3c099cca6c3f.md) | Constructs a new instance of a filter to match elements with a bounding box that contains the given point. |
|  | [BoundingBoxContainsPointFilter(XYZ, Boolean)](349bf4ad-de49-f6fe-f223-6d782b70570f.md) | Constructs a new instance of a filter to match elements with a bounding box that contains the given point, with the option to invert the filter and match all elements with a bounding box that do not contain the given point. |
|  | [BoundingBoxContainsPointFilter(XYZ, Double)](2d8feb9b-f5db-35b7-fef7-98c9ed0c5cce.md) | Constructs a new instance of a filter to match elements with a bounding box that contains the given point, while specifying the tolerance to be used in deciding if the point matches the criteria. |
|  | [BoundingBoxContainsPointFilter(XYZ, Double, Boolean)](d2891b1c-b50c-cadc-addf-9256d44efd12.md) | Constructs a new instance of a filter to match elements with a bounding box that contains the given point, while specifying the tolerance to be used in deciding if the point matches the criteria. This constructor includes the option to invert the filter and match all elements with a bounding box that do not contain the given point. |
  
# Methods

|  | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | [Dispose](5d3ffdf8-dce9-0724-d101-44693775671c.md) | (Inherited from [ElementFilter](b8b46cbf-9ecc-0745-ec53-c3c3b6510113.md).) |
|  | Equals | Determines whether the specified Object is equal to the current Object. (Inherited from Object.) |
|  | GetHashCode | Serves as a hash function for a particular type.  (Inherited from Object.) |
|  | GetType | Gets the Type of the current instance. (Inherited from Object.) |
|  | [PassesFilter(Element)](1402f6e0-995c-2644-c7a9-7016a81a4ef4.md) | Applies the filter to a given element.  (Inherited from [ElementFilter](b8b46cbf-9ecc-0745-ec53-c3c3b6510113.md).) |
|  | [PassesFilter(Document, ElementId)](a8e86084-b91f-c3cf-c334-e163168328d6.md) | Applies the filter to a given element.  (Inherited from [ElementFilter](b8b46cbf-9ecc-0745-ec53-c3c3b6510113.md).) |
|  | ToString | Returns a string that represents the current object. (Inherited from Object.) |
  
# Properties

|  | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | [Inverted](ceab2eea-cc4c-d7dc-b34c-b3c1f012eda1.md) | True if the results of the filter are inverted; elements that would normally be accepted by this filter will be rejected, and elements that would normally be rejected will be accepted.  (Inherited from [ElementFilter](b8b46cbf-9ecc-0745-ec53-c3c3b6510113.md).) |
|  | [IsValidObject](027ccc75-b7f6-4ee2-cf98-563df96b0dbb.md) | Specifies whether the .NET object represents a valid Revit entity.  (Inherited from [ElementFilter](b8b46cbf-9ecc-0745-ec53-c3c3b6510113.md).) |
|  | [Point](16b16bda-222b-5b5c-93d0-c6188f3fb1a2.md) | The XYZ point to use when matching element bounding boxes. |
|  | [Tolerance](c5f8cb9d-75ea-8e8d-b985-5318a06921bf.md) | Allows control over the match criteria by using a tolerance in the geometry comparison. It is suggested to use this in cases where trivial differences should be considered when matching elements. |
