# Remarks

This event is raised when Revit is just about to open a linked resource. Only supports linked resources for following types : Revit; IFC; CAD(dwg, dxf, dgn, sat); This event would not be raised if there are no update on linked CAD, IFC resources. 

Event is not cancellable.

The linked resource cannot be modified, for it is not opened yet at the time of the event.

Another [LinkedResourceOpened](58045f61-5a60-aa9e-5360-afb39e51268e.md) event will be raised immediately after linked resource is opened.
