# Remarks

You cannot change the PathType to or from PathType.Server. The path type will change automatically if you call RevitLinkType.LoadFrom with a Revit Server path. 

Links from external resource servers are considered to have no path type. Attempts to access this property for an external server link will result in an exception.
