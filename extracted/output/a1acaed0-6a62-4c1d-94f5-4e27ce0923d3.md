# Remarks

Custom families within the Revit API represented by three objects - Family, FamilySymbol and [FamilyInstance](0d2231f8-91e6-794f-92ae-16aad8014b27.md). Each object plays a significant part in the structure of families. The Family element represents the entire family that consists of a collection of types, such as an 'I Beam'. You can think of that object as representing the entire family file. The Family object contains a number of FamilySymbol elements. The FamilySymbol object represents a specific set of family settings within that Family and represents what is known in the Revit user interface as a Type, such as 'W14x32'. The [FamilyInstance](0d2231f8-91e6-794f-92ae-16aad8014b27.md) object represents an actual instance of that type placed the Autodesk Revit project. For example the [FamilyInstance](0d2231f8-91e6-794f-92ae-16aad8014b27.md) would be a single instance of a W14x32 column within the project.
