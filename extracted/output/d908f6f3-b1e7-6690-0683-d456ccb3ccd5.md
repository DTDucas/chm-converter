|  | [Equals](89ffea83-f105-0468-af9b-eb00d5de1b97.md) | Determines whether this ForgeTypeId is equal to another.  (Overrides Object..::..Equals(Object).) |
|  | [GetHashCode](1d1a018e-d28f-a4bd-f793-f483a1eb2e44.md) | Returns the hash code for this ForgeTypeId  (Overrides Object..::..GetHashCode()()()().) |
