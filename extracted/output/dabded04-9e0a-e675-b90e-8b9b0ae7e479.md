**Namespace:** [Autodesk.Revit.DB](87546ba7-461b-c646-cbb1-2cb8f5bff8b2.md)**Assembly:** RevitAPI (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 24.0.0.0 (24.0.0.0)**Since:** 2024 

# Syntax

C#  
---  
      
    
    public void Simplify(
    	double percentage
    )  
  
Visual Basic  
---  
      
    
    Public Sub Simplify ( _
    	percentage As Double _
    )  
  
Visual C++  
---  
      
    
    public:
    void Simplify(
    	double percentage
    )  
  
#### Parameters

percentage
    Type: System..::..Double The ratio of the number of inner vertices after simplify to the original number. 

# Remarks

At low percentages, the inner vertices may not be reduced to the exact percentage to keep a rough semblance of the original shape. Call this method again if you want to keep removing inner vertices. 

# Exceptions
