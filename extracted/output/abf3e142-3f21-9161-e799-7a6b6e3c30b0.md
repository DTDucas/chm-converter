**Namespace:** [Autodesk.Revit.DB.IFC](b823fafb-1ba1-896b-4097-142c2817ce74.md)**Assembly:** RevitAPI (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 24.0.0.0 (24.0.0.0)**Since:** 2015 

# Syntax

C#  
---  
      
    
    public bool AutoJoin { get; set; }  
  
Visual Basic  
---  
      
    
    Public Property AutoJoin As Boolean
    	Get
    	Set  
  
Visual C++  
---  
      
    
    public:
    property bool AutoJoin {
    	bool get ();
    	void set (bool value);
    }  
  
# Remarks

Enabling auto-join will join appropriate elements (e.g., walls, columns), but will take extra time and may fail. Disabling auto-join will allow some imports that otherwise fail. Default is true for Open IFC; it is ignored (and false) for Link IFC.
