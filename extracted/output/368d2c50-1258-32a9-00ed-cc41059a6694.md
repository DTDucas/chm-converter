# Remarks

Each instance makes sure that any elements and products created during its lifetime are properly associated to their parent level (or other containing object). To ensure that the lifetime of the object is correctly managed, you should declare an instance of this class as a part of a 'using' statement in C# or similar construct in other lanuguages.
