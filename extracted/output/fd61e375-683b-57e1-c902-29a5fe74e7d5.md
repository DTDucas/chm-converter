# Syntax

    Public Property SupportActivation As Boolean
    	Get
    	Set

    public:
    property bool SupportActivation {
    	bool get ();
    	void set (bool value);
    }  
  
# Remarks

If this option is set to true servers can be activated/deactivated.

If this option is set to false, for a single-server only one server can be added(registered) and will be considered active. In case of a multi-server service multiple servers cand be added(registered) and all of them will be considered active. An attempt to activate/deactivate the servers will lead to an exception.

A service for which SupportActivation is set to false, can't be recordable and self-synchronizing.
