An iterator to traverse the MEP analytical network. 

**Namespace:** [Autodesk.Revit.DB.Analysis](958e2e12-587d-f188-5d7b-f13d7dbfdf48.md)**Assembly:** RevitAPI (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 24.0.0.0 (24.0.0.0)**Since:** 2024 

# Syntax

C#

    public class MEPNetworkIterator : IDisposable  
  
Visual Basic

    Public Class MEPNetworkIterator _
    	Implements IDisposable  
  
Visual C++

    public ref class MEPNetworkIterator : IDisposable  
  
# Remarks

The iterator will visit the entire MEP analytical network in the depth-first order. For evert next step, one analytical node and one analytical segment are typically visited. Sometimes an extra node is provided if the iteration reaches the end on one side and restarts at the previous intersect node. Also note that the start step may not contain any segment. 

# Examples

CopyC#
    
    
    // Create a new MEPNetworkIterator to traverse a piping network in the depth-first order.
    int segmentCount = 0;
    MEPNetworkIterator netIter = new MEPNetworkIterator(doc, modelData, ConnectorDomainType.Piping);
    for(netIter.Start(); !netIter.End(); netIter.Next())
    {
       MEPAnalyticalSegment segment = netIter.GetAnalyticalSegment();
       if (segment != null)
          segmentCount++;
    }
