|  | Equals | Determines whether the specified Object is equal to the current Object. (Inherited from Object.) |
|  | [GetBoundingBox](711f34fc-b170-5527-7fe1-b1b925000ce5.md) | Gets the outline being used for this filter. |
|  | GetHashCode | Serves as a hash function for a particular type.  (Inherited from Object.) |
|  | GetType | Gets the Type of the current instance. (Inherited from Object.) |
|  | [PassesFilter(Element)](1402f6e0-995c-2644-c7a9-7016a81a4ef4.md) | Applies the filter to a given element.  (Inherited from [ElementFilter](b8b46cbf-9ecc-0745-ec53-c3c3b6510113.md).) |
|  | [PassesFilter(Document, ElementId)](a8e86084-b91f-c3cf-c334-e163168328d6.md) | Applies the filter to a given element.  (Inherited from [ElementFilter](b8b46cbf-9ecc-0745-ec53-c3c3b6510113.md).) |
|  | ToString | Returns a string that represents the current object. (Inherited from Object.) |
  
# Properties

|  | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | [Inverted](ceab2eea-cc4c-d7dc-b34c-b3c1f012eda1.md) | True if the results of the filter are inverted; elements that would normally be accepted by this filter will be rejected, and elements that would normally be rejected will be accepted.  (Inherited from [ElementFilter](b8b46cbf-9ecc-0745-ec53-c3c3b6510113.md).) |
|  | [IsValidObject](027ccc75-b7f6-4ee2-cf98-563df96b0dbb.md) | Specifies whether the .NET object represents a valid Revit entity.  (Inherited from [ElementFilter](b8b46cbf-9ecc-0745-ec53-c3c3b6510113.md).) |
|  | [Tolerance](c54d7e5e-209b-82c4-4723-067a8668a674.md) | Allows control over the match criteria by using a tolerance in the geometry comparison. It is suggested to use this in cases where trivial differences should be considered when matching elements. |
