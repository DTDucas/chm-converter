| [GetBoundingBox](711f34fc-b170-5527-7fe1-b1b925000ce5.md "GetBoundingBox Method") | Gets the outline being used for this filter. |
| GetHashCode | Serves as a hash function for a particular type.  (Inherited from Object.) |
| GetType | Gets the Type of the current instance. (Inherited from Object.) |
| [PassesFilter(Element)](1402f6e0-995c-2644-c7a9-7016a81a4ef4.md "PassesFilter Method \(Element\)") | Applies the filter to a given element.  (Inherited from [ElementFilter](b8b46cbf-9ecc-0745-ec53-c3c3b6510113.md "ElementFilter Class").) |
| [PassesFilter(Document, ElementId)](a8e86084-b91f-c3cf-c334-e163168328d6.md "PassesFilter Method \(Document, ElementId\)") | Applies the filter to a given element.  (Inherited from [ElementFilter](b8b46cbf-9ecc-0745-ec53-c3c3b6510113.md "ElementFilter Class").) |

| [Inverted](ceab2eea-cc4c-d7dc-b34c-b3c1f012eda1.md "Inverted Property") | True if the results of the filter are inverted; elements that would normally be accepted by this filter will be rejected, and elements that would normally be rejected will be accepted.  (Inherited from [ElementFilter](b8b46cbf-9ecc-0745-ec53-c3c3b6510113.md "ElementFilter Class").) |
| [IsValidObject](027ccc75-b7f6-4ee2-cf98-563df96b0dbb.md "IsValidObject Property") | Specifies whether the .NET object represents a valid Revit entity.  (Inherited from [ElementFilter](b8b46cbf-9ecc-0745-ec53-c3c3b6510113.md "ElementFilter Class").) |
| [Tolerance](c54d7e5e-209b-82c4-4723-067a8668a674.md "Tolerance Property") | Allows control over the match criteria by using a tolerance in the geometry comparison. It is suggested to use this in cases where trivial differences should be considered when matching elements. |
