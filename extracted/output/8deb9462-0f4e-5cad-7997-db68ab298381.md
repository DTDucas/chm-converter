# Properties

|  | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | [Absorptance](fcb075d8-7c62-197e-2054-ef609df490d0.md) | Value of absorptance. |
|  | [HeatTransferCoefficient](fbedc21e-9c5e-7197-917e-70996023126d.md) | The heat transfer coefficient value (U-Value). The unit is watts per meter-squared kelvin (W/(m^2*K)). |
|  | [IsReadOnly](d516bcd2-a3fd-a578-58f6-f1add979bd07.md) | Identifies if the object is read-only or modifiable. (Inherited from [APIObject](beb86ef5-39ad-3f0d-0cd9-0c929387a2bb.md).) |
|  | [IsValidObject](3946b7c9-11d6-31f5-bee2-be16cb86d525.md) | Specifies whether the .NET object represents a valid Revit entity. |
|  | [Roughness](c6f24d0d-9a50-5ddc-3e18-da5df3bf5f96.md) | Value of roughness. |
|  | [ThermalMass](5f66e430-8a45-39c2-e0f2-ab0456756721.md) | The calculated thermal mass value. The unit is kilogram feet-squared per second squared kelvin (kg ft^2/(s^2 K)). |
|  | [ThermalResistance](e234bed0-4903-7181-dcc2-de8d7e273eb1.md) | The calculated thermal resistance value (R-Value). The unit is meter-squared kelvin per watt ((m^2*K)/Watt). |
