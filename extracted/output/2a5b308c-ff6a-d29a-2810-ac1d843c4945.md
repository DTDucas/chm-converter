#### Parameters

isSolid
    Type: System..::..BooleanIndicates if the Form is Solid or Void.

path
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..ReferenceArray](bc9192b5-6666-a8de-0128-87dae479fd6a.md)The path of the swept blend. The path should be 2D, where all input curves lie in one plane. If there's more than one profile, the path should be a single curve. It's required to reference existing geometry.

profiles
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..ReferenceArrayArray](b50edc19-b437-2aab-bd03-5d1a0aed4164.md)The profile set of the newly created swept blend. Each profile should consist of only one curve loop. Each profile must be in a plane that intersects with the path and is perpendicular to the path at the point of intersection.

#### Return Value

If creation was successful new form is returned.
