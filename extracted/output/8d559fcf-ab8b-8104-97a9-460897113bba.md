# Syntax

void SetActiveServer(
	Guid serverId
)
```
  
# ### Parameters
serverId
    Type: System..::..Guid Id of the application server. 
# Remarks
Only one server can be active at any given time in a single-server service, but it is possible that no server is active (unless the service is mandatory). 
An application-wide active server gets executed when the service is invoked in the scope of the entire application (i.e. without a specific document), or if the service is executed in a document but the document does not have an active server explicitly set. 
For a service which has cref="Autodesk::Revit::DB::ExternalService::SupportActivation" set to true it is possible to set a server as active when another server is already active for that service. Making a server active will automatically deactivate the server that was active before this call. 
For a service which has cref="Autodesk::Revit::DB::ExternalService::SupportActivation" set to false calling this method will throw exception. For this kind of service only one server can be added, and it will be marked by default as active.
