#### Parameters

curve
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..Curve](400cc9b6-9ff7-de85-6fd8-c20002209d25.md)The curve where the instance is based.

symbol
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..FamilySymbol](a1acaed0-6a62-4c1d-94f5-4e27ce0923d3.md)A FamilySymbol object that represents the type of the instance that is to be inserted.

level
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..Level](577e5d4e-a558-118c-9dea-3b810b061775.md)A Level object that is used as the base level for the object.

structuralType
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB.Structure..::..StructuralType](0a0a3793-5fce-283d-4953-a137f5593db9.md) If structural then specify the type of the component. 

#### Return Value

If creation was successful then an instance to the new object is returned, otherwise nullNothingnullptra null reference (Nothing in Visual Basic).

# Remarks

This method is used to insert one family instance into another element along the geometry of a curve. If the instance fails to be created an exception may be thrown. 

The type/symbol that is used must be loaded into the document before this method is called. Families and their symbols can be loaded using the Document.LoadFamily or Document.LoadFamilySymbol methods. 

The host object must be one that supports insertion of instances otherwise this method will fail. All levels within the document can be found by iterating over the entire document and searching for objects of type Autodesk.Revit.Elements.Level.

Note: if the created family instance includes nested instances, the API framework will automatically regenerate the document during this method call.

# Examples

CopyC#
    
    
    FamilyInstance CreateBeam(Autodesk.Revit.DB.Document document, View view)
    {
    
       // get the given view's level for beam creation
        Level level = document.GetElement(view.LevelId) as Level;
    
        // get a family symbol
        FilteredElementCollector collector = new FilteredElementCollector(document);
        collector.OfClass(typeof(FamilySymbol)).OfCategory(BuiltInCategory.OST_StructuralFraming);
    
        FamilySymbol gotSymbol = collector.FirstElement() as FamilySymbol;
    
        // create new beam 10' long starting at origin
        XYZ startPoint = new XYZ(0, 0, 0);
        XYZ endPoint = new Autodesk.Revit.DB.XYZ(10, 0, 0);
    
        Autodesk.Revit.DB.Curve beamLine = Line.CreateBound(startPoint, endPoint);
    
        // create a new beam
        FamilyInstance instance = document.Create.NewFamilyInstance(beamLine, gotSymbol,
                                                                    level, StructuralType.Beam);
    
        return instance;
    }
