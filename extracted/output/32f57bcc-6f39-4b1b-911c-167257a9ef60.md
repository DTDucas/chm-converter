|  | [Dispose](d6553ff4-ddab-93af-8121-27d4c447b64e.md) | Releases all resources used by the [BalusterPattern](bb7868e3-0665-07e5-59e4-a95efb3079ab.md) |
|  | [DuplicateBaluster](10f4c489-9d7e-5520-f8a0-b50a53d87dc5.md) | Duplicates the baluster pointed by given index in the main baluster pattern. |

# Properties

|  | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | [BreakPattern](c03aa9c6-809c-71c1-a919-f6689afc8b74.md) | The condition which controls breaking baluster patterns distribution. |
|  | [DistributionJustification](f9108468-6603-5766-52fb-9914c441d59b.md) | Determines how baluster pattern distribution is justified. |
|  | [EndSpace](8bddb1cd-e2d2-cace-282e-a261edb41a11.md) | The extra space added after a whole baluster pattern. |
|  | [ExcessLengthFillBalusterId](f65fecb5-e3c1-6a68-dd67-c4e951efdc74.md) | The id of a Baluster family used to fill excess length, which is the extra space along the railing segment that cannot be filled with a pattern. If set to InvalidElementId, it will be the default - the id of the BaseRailingAttr containing the Baluster pattern. |
|  | [ExcessLengthFillSpacing](3c54b11b-724a-cd4c-0b80-abcd141fada7.md) | The value defines the spacing between each baluster instance inserted in the excess length. |
|  | [IsValidObject](d9228ba8-54ab-410c-c958-849daf7ead68.md) | Specifies whether the .NET object represents a valid Revit entity. |
|  | [Length](cf31fd06-b2a9-0bcc-24ea-7d8fb273bec4.md) | The length of the main baluster pattern. |
