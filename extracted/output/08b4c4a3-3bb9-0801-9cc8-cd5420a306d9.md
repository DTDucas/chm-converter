A class representing a handle on a Rebar that can be joined to a reference, such as a host Element's surface or cover, or another Rebar's handle.

# Remarks

A rebar element's flexible geometry is controlled by several handles. The shape of the bar is controlled by a handle at each end of the bar (blue circle controls) and a handle each edge (blue triangle controls). Another handle is used to control the location of the plane in which the rebar lies. An additional handle controls the length of a set of rebar.

RebarConstrainedHandles can only be constructed internally by Revit. They are available to the API by querying a rebar element's RebarConstraintsManager.
