| DoNothing | Revit is instructed to do nothing. It is assumed that the service already handled what needed to be handled (e.g. it set servers appropriately to the situation.) |
| ApplyDefaults | Revit is to apply the default algorithm which is to activate just the servers that are remaining available. It could also mean that no server will be set at all if the servers previously used in the document are not currently registered. If such a situation happens for a mandatory service, then the service's default server will be set as the new (and only) active server. |
| LetUserDecide | Revit is to prompt the end-user to let him or her decide whether a default action should be applied or a selection of servers should be set. |
