#### Parameters

server
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB.ExternalService..::..IExternalServer](91e4af0b-59c0-d640-107a-eebc4d99fa76.md) An instance of a server that is to be validated. 

#### Return Value

True if the server is valid, False otherwise 

# Remarks

This method is invoked by the framework upon registration of a server for this service. The simplest implementation would be to test whether the type of the object is as expected, but a service may have other rules for validating its servers.
