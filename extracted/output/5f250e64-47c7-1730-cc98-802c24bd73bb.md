The [VertexBuffer](329e5617-ce46-a993-1131-85c64f0842f2.md) type exposes the following members.

# Methods

|  | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | [Dispose](3b9f2298-d268-34b0-405f-754557e1ca49.md) |  |
|  | Equals | Determines whether the specified Object is equal to the current Object. (Inherited from Object.) |
|  | GetHashCode | Serves as a hash function for a particular type.  (Inherited from Object.) |
|  | [GetMappedHandle](5c72f0d1-a411-a0dc-9254-45aac63a2a2a.md) | Gets a handle to the buffer's memory that has been mapped. Writing data to the buffer using the handle is an alternative to using stream objects. |
|  | GetType | Gets the Type of the current instance. (Inherited from Object.) |
|  | [GetVertexStreamPosition](622eea58-8f57-1f8b-f36f-47df37778212.md) | Gets a stream that can be used to write vertices of type [VertexPosition](718e49aa-9e17-6f2d-2013-141b5cfeefdd.md) into the buffer. |
|  | [GetVertexStreamPositionColored](a383c1a4-df45-0a71-4b03-fca1194dcd36.md) | Gets a stream that can be used to write vertices of type [VertexPositionColored](f99deacd-3167-46ff-6abf-5d27bdbd2c6a.md) into the buffer. |
|  | [GetVertexStreamPositionNormal](75da6967-bc49-85f8-5630-7a13dc679609.md) | Gets a stream that can be used to write vertices of type [VertexPositionNormal](a40efda7-6e2f-a455-f65e-02b10b0bc1b4.md) into the buffer. |
|  | [GetVertexStreamPositionNormalColored](b4ee5ac8-8fad-4861-01c4-b249e1d40c0f.md) | Gets a stream that can be used to write vertices of type [VertexPositionNormalColored](aa354e03-2b25-b5a4-5634-c3518518c0d3.md) into the buffer. |
|  | [IsValid](82448bdd-a0a4-61f2-fbbd-91a4988f6ce6.md) | Tests whether the buffer is valid for rendering. |
|  | [Map](25906237-dd27-22a6-96cf-c480869fe02b.md) | Maps a portion of the buffer into memory, so that vertex data can be written into it. (see [VertexStream](a7a2d911-e3e4-84a7-a0c2-6aa5a28ae2ed.md)). |
|  | ToString | Returns a string that represents the current object. (Inherited from Object.) |
|  | [Unmap](763dedd5-6fdc-84b8-e3ec-18694d5d3382.md) | Unmaps the buffer, so that it can be used for rendering. |
