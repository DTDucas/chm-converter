# Remarks

This function should only rarely be needed, but might be required when working with graphics drawn from outside of Revit's transactions and elements, for example, when using [IDirectContext3DServer](7709521d-9954-ef80-1f13-3bc6ee660d5d.md). This function is potentially expensive as many views may be updated at once, including regeneration of view's geometry and redisplay of graphics. Thus for most situations it is recommended that API applications rely on the Revit application framework to update views more deliberately.
