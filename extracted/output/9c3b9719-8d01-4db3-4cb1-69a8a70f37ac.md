# Syntax

C#

    public [CompoundStructure](dc1a081e-8dab-565f-145d-a429098d353c.md) GetSimpleCompoundStructure(
    	double wallHeight,
    	double distAboveBase
    )

    Public Function GetSimpleCompoundStructure ( _
    	wallHeight As Double, _
    	distAboveBase As Double _
    ) As [CompoundStructure](dc1a081e-8dab-565f-145d-a429098d353c.md)

    public:
    [CompoundStructure](dc1a081e-8dab-565f-145d-a429098d353c.md)^ GetSimpleCompoundStructure(
    	double wallHeight, 
    	double distAboveBase
    )  
  
#### Parameters

wallHeight
    Type: System..::..Double The height of the wall. 

distAboveBase
    Type: System..::..Double The distance from the base of the wall at which to take the section. If distAboveBase < 0, then internally distAboveBase = 0 is used. If distAboveBase > wallHeight, then internally distAboveBase = wallHeight is used. 

#### Return Value

A simple CompoundStructure representing a series of parallel layers. 

# Remarks

If [IsVerticallyCompound](cd352f22-8ca4-b3b6-f247-d9865a91bb6f.md) is false, the output is a copy of this CompoundStructure.
