    [Mesh](bf9cd59c-03c3-9e7f-1e2b-6aaf5c425b69.md)^ Triangulate()  
  
# Remarks

Tolerance of approximation is defined internally by Revit to be adequate for display purposes.

# Examples

CopyC#
    
    
    private void TriangulateFace(Face face)
    {
        // Get mesh
        Mesh mesh = face.Triangulate();
        for (int i = 0; i < mesh.NumTriangles; i++)
        {
            MeshTriangle triangle = mesh.get_Triangle(i);
            XYZ vertex1 = triangle.get_Vertex(0);
            XYZ vertex2 = triangle.get_Vertex(1);
            XYZ vertex3 = triangle.get_Vertex(2);
        }
    }

CopyVB.NET
    
    
    Private Sub TriangulateFace(face As Face)
        ' Get mesh
        Dim mesh As Mesh = face.Triangulate()
        For i As Integer = 0 To mesh.NumTriangles - 1
            Dim triangle As MeshTriangle = mesh.Triangle(i)
            Dim vertex1 As XYZ = triangle.Vertex(0)
            Dim vertex2 As XYZ = triangle.Vertex(1)
            Dim vertex3 As XYZ = triangle.Vertex(2)
        Next
    End Sub
