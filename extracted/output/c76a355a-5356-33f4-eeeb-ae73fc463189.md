# Remarks

The position defines a point on the edge of the text area, not a point on the border (if a border is defined for the style.) It means that if the width of the border gets changed, the position of the text area remains unchanged.

The relation of the position point with respect to the text area depends on the text alignment as follows:

  * For Left-aligned text the point is at the Left-Top corned of the box.
  * For Center-aligned text the point is at the Middle-Top corned of the box.
  * For Right-aligned text the point is at the Right-Top corned of the box.
