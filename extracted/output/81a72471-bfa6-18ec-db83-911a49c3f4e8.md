    public:
    bool IsAlmostEqualTo(
    	[XYZ](c2fd995c-95c0-58fb-f5de-f3246cbc5600.md)^ source, 
    	double tolerance
    )  
  
#### Parameters

source
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..XYZ](c2fd995c-95c0-58fb-f5de-f3246cbc5600.md)The vector to compare with this vector.

tolerance
    Type: System..::..DoubleThe tolerance for equality check.

#### Return Value

True if the vectors are the same; otherwise, false.

# Remarks

This routine uses an input tolerance to compare two vectors to see if they are almost equivalent. Because it is comparing two vectors the tolerance value is not in length units but instead represents the variation in direction between the vectors. For very small tolerance values it should also be possible to compare two points with this method. To compute the distance between two points for a comparison with a larger allowable difference, use [DistanceTo(XYZ)](ecbbee02-8f32-d5e9-a565-9c072543ea4f.md).
