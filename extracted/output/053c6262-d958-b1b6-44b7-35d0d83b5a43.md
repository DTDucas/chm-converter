An interface that may be used to perform a preprocessing step to either filter out anticipated transaction failures or to mark certain failures as non-continuable. 

**Namespace:** [Autodesk.Revit.DB](87546ba7-461b-c646-cbb1-2cb8f5bff8b2.md)**Assembly:** RevitAPI (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 24.0.0.0 (24.0.0.0)**Since:** 2011 

# Syntax

C#

    public interface IFailuresPreprocessor

    Public Interface IFailuresPreprocessor

    public interface class IFailuresPreprocessor  
  
# Remarks

This interface, if provided, is invoked when there are failures found at the end of a transaction. An instance of this interface can be set in the failure handling options of transaction object. 

# Examples

CopyC#
    
    
    public class RoomWarningSwallower : IFailuresPreprocessor
    {
        public FailureProcessingResult PreprocessFailures(FailuresAccessor failuresAccessor)
        {
            IList<FailureMessageAccessor> failList = new List<FailureMessageAccessor>();
            // Inside event handler, get all warnings
            failList = failuresAccessor.GetFailureMessages(); 
            foreach (FailureMessageAccessor failure in failList)
            { 
                // check FailureDefinitionIds against ones that you want to dismiss, 
                FailureDefinitionId failID = failure.GetFailureDefinitionId();
                // prevent Revit from showing Unenclosed room warnings

            return FailureProcessingResult.Continue;
        }
    }
