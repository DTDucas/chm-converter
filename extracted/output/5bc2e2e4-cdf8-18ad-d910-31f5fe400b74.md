#### Parameters

messageKey
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..FailureMessageKey](f0fa1b40-5df3-ddaf-e38d-85bd438a89e3.md) The key of the FailureMessage to be deleted. 

# Remarks

If code that previously has posted a failure is executed again or otherwise detects that failure conditions do not exist anymore and the failure is not longer relevant, it should delete a failure message in order to let transaction to be committed. In order to delete the failure, it should invoke this method with a message key that was returned when the failure was posted.
