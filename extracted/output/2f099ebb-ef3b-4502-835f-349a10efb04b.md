# ### Parameters
document
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..Document](db03274b-a107-aa32-9034-f3e0df4bb1ec.md "Document Class") The document. 
connector1
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..Connector](11e07082-b3f2-26a1-de79-16535f44716c.md "Connector Class") The first end connector of placeholder to be connected to the second. 
connector2
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..Connector](11e07082-b3f2-26a1-de79-16535f44716c.md "Connector Class") The second end connector of placeholder to be connected to the first. 
connector3
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..Connector](11e07082-b3f2-26a1-de79-16535f44716c.md "Connector Class") The third end connector of placeholder to be connected to the forth. 
connector4
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..Connector](11e07082-b3f2-26a1-de79-16535f44716c.md "Connector Class") The fourth end connector of placeholder to be connected to the third. 
# ### Return Value
True if connection succeeds, false otherwise. 
# Remarks
The placeholders may or may not have physical connection. However a) The ends of four connectors should intersect at same point; b) the first and second placeholders should be collinear each other; c) the third and fourth placeholders should be collinear each other and d) the third and fourth should have intersection with first or second placeholder. If connection fails, the placeholders cannot be physically connected.
