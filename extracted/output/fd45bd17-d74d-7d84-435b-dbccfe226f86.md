|  | [AreOrientationOptionsChanged](b5914526-ddbb-9633-e263-822ccee2a043.md) | Indicates if the orientation options have changed since the last regeneration. |
|  | [AreWorkshopInstructionsChanged](4edc3d5e-dd8c-5549-6766-03319c538b7c.md) | Indicates if the workshop instructions have changed since the last regeneration. |
|  | [CycleCounterChanged](9edec8b1-5f5e-8ccc-afb5-4b2aeb5de23d.md) | True if the cycle counter was changed, false otherwise.The cycle counter value is changed when the free form Rebar element is selected and the user press Space key -or- by through [!:Autodesk::Revit::DB::Structure::RebarRebarFreeFormAccessor::CycleCounter] property. -or- by the server if it considers that the counter reaches the maximum value and reset it (set it to 0). |
|  | [ErrorMessage](858682bf-3961-9f2b-c515-6b6178ca7f36.md) | The reason for calculation failure. If the calculation fails, this message will be shown in an error, or warning if we are editing the constraints. |
|  | [HostMirrored](7e5256ff-5025-9091-5056-c2261eadbc71.md) | If true, then host of the rebar was mirrorred (along with the rebar) before this regeneration. |
|  | [IsAttachmentTypeChanged](a4e69222-df6f-43e8-d771-8057ede14f59.md) | Indicates if the attachment type has changed since the last regeneration. |
|  | [IsBarsNumberChanged](f9c25fd6-9a2b-3256-87f5-5263b81b50ae.md) | Indicates if the bar number has changed since the last regeneration. |
|  | [IsBendingRadiusChanged](b2d9fe7c-8574-cbd1-649b-f85e323c9023.md) | Indicates if the bending radius has changed since the last regeneration. |

After mirroring, curves created from intersecting faces may be reversed, so we use this to store the state and keep the rebar pointing in the correct direction. |
