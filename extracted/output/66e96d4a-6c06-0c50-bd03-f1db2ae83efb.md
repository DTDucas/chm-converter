# Members
| Member name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| --- | --- |
| ViewScale | Exporting lines as they were scaled by view scale. This option preserves visual fidelity. |
| ModelSpace | Modelspace scaling. LTSCALE is set to view scale and PSLTSCALE to 0. |
| PaperSpace | Paperspace scaling. Specifies the value 1 for both LTSCALE and PSLTSCALE. |

# Remarks
Whichever option is chosen, line type definitions are created so a dashed line always begins and ends with a dash. Using these options does change the default behavior of exported DWGs. Some lines expected to be dashed may appear solid or in a different scale.
