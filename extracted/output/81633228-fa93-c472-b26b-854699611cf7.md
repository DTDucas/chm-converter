The [RebarShapeMultiplanarDefinition](47a3135c-ce53-c041-f551-0795767eaa41.md) type exposes the following members.

# Properties

|  | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | [DepthParamId](e9620a9a-6d57-1a05-7eb8-7493d5327bcb.md) | Id of the parameter driving the multiplanar depth. The depth is measured center-to-center of the bar. A valid shape parameter must be assigned to DepthParamId before the MultiplanarDefinition can be used in RebarShape creation. |
|  | [IsDuplicateShapePresent](f7f61202-829e-00fd-2541-65e86872237c.md) | Whether the shape definition includes an offset copy of the 2D shape. |
|  | [IsEndConnectorPresent](1527f49a-54f5-4a52-cefc-a47d01dda2c9.md) | Whether a perpendicular segment is constructed from the end of the 2D shape. |
|  | [IsStartConnectorPresent](95716e5c-3765-0482-de92-d81a644bf158.md) | Whether a perpendicular segment is constructed from the start of the 2D shape. |
|  | [IsValidObject](79eb0f31-fe7c-16c9-0825-79c73c4f9fff.md) | Specifies whether the .NET object represents a valid Revit entity. |
|  | [OutOfPlaneBendDiameter](d1fe3a4b-998e-f726-ef0d-befe41cb01f8.md) | Bend diameter to be applied to the connector segments. |
