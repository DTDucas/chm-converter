|  | [CreateCurve(HermiteSpline)](c0191746-fdd6-4f24-cfb7-29a6a88bc05b.md) | Creates a new geometric Curve object by converting the given HermiteSpline. The created curve may be a NURBSpline or a simpler curve such as line or arc. |
|  | [CreateCurve(IList<(Of <<'(XYZ>)>>), IList<(Of <<'(Double>)>>))](0ef02fb4-1ef1-6adb-dfb6-680eba6fed62.md) | Creates a new geometric Curve object from NURBS curve data containing just control points and weights. The created curve may be a NURBSpline or a simpler curve such as line or arc. |
|  | [CreateCurve(Int32, IList<(Of <<'(Double>)>>), IList<(Of <<'(XYZ>)>>))](af148d8b-db79-2000-4e0f-030fc30a78ca.md) | Creates a new geometric Curve object from NURBS curve data, which does not include weights. The created curve may be a NURBSpline or a simpler curve such as line or arc. |
|  | [CreateCurve(Int32, IList<(Of <<'(Double>)>>), IList<(Of <<'(XYZ>)>>), IList<(Of <<'(Double>)>>))](a0d68a24-0bda-0322-111c-e9f1011149c9.md) | Creates a new geometric Curve object from NURBS curve data, which includes weights. The created curve may be a NURBSpline or a simpler curve such as line or arc. |
