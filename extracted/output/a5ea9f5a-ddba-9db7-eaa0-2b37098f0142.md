# Remarks

This filter excludes all objects derived from View and objects derived from ElementType. This filter is a quick filter. Quick filters operate only on the ElementRecord, a low-memory class which has a limited interface to read element properties. Elements which are rejected by a quick filter will not be expanded in memory. 

# Examples

CopyC#
    
    
    // Use BoundingBoxContainsPoint filter to find elements with a bounding box that contains the 
    // given point in the document.
    
    // Create a BoundingBoxContainsPoint filter for base point of (0, 0, 0)
    XYZ basePnt = new XYZ(0, 0, 0);
    BoundingBoxContainsPointFilter filter = new BoundingBoxContainsPointFilter(basePnt);
    
    // Apply the filter to the elements in the active document
    // This filter will excludes all objects derived from View and objects derived from ElementType
    FilteredElementCollector collector = new FilteredElementCollector(document);
    IList<Element> elements = collector.WherePasses(filter).ToElements();
    
    
    // Find walls that do not contain the given point: use an inverted filter to match elements
    // Use shortcut command OfClass() to find walls only
    BoundingBoxContainsPointFilter notContainFilter =
        new BoundingBoxContainsPointFilter(basePnt, true); // inverted filter
    collector = new FilteredElementCollector(document);
    IList<Element> notContainFounds =
        collector.OfClass(typeof(Wall)).WherePasses(notContainFilter).ToElements();
