    }  
  
#### Field Value

AttachmentType.Overlay if this link is an overlay, AttachmentType.Attachment if this link is an attachment. 

# Remarks

"Attachment" links are considered to be part of their parent link and will be brought along if their parent is linked into another document. "Overlay" links are only visible when their parent is open directly.

For example: A user has a file B which contains a link C, and they wish to link B into another file, A. If C is an overlay, C will not be loaded into A. If C is an attachment, then C will be loaded into A along with B.
