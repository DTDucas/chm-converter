The [CylindricalSurface](95d452c1-6f7f-9d8e-a4fb-e2f1fe2818bc.md) type exposes the following members.

# Methods

|  | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | [Create](ae360b1d-65c3-2991-62c7-13193f5792e5.md) | Construct a cylindrical surface defined by a local coordinate system and a radius. |
|  | [Dispose](c9ee1344-bc19-d833-52e7-dcc4931fe085.md) | (Inherited from [Surface](bb391358-5ca0-578d-e8e2-6d1b30c472d8.md).) |
|  | Equals | Determines whether the specified Object is equal to the current Object. (Inherited from Object.) |
|  | [GetBoundingBoxUV](5084214f-219f-780f-fe03-f16b62b2660d.md) | Gets the UV bounding box of the surface.  (Inherited from [Surface](bb391358-5ca0-578d-e8e2-6d1b30c472d8.md).) |
|  | [GetFrameOfReference](547f05b7-1e57-bc40-8df8-681fb80e61e9.md) | Returns frame of reference associated with this CylindricalSurface. |
|  | GetHashCode | Serves as a hash function for a particular type.  (Inherited from Object.) |
|  | GetType | Gets the Type of the current instance. (Inherited from Object.) |
|  | [Project](802cc09b-d0a4-dfc5-8ca1-e8c5e8cd4ced.md) | Project a 3D point orthogonally onto a surface (to find the nearest point). Throws InvalidOperationException if the projection fails.  (Inherited from [Surface](bb391358-5ca0-578d-e8e2-6d1b30c472d8.md).) |
|  | [ProjectWithGuessPoint](db8cc42a-9f34-611a-d9c5-852f3935887f.md) | Project a 3D point orthogonally onto a surface (to find the nearest point). This method is meant to be used when a good approximate solution for the projection is available. Throws InvalidOperationException if the projection fails.  (Inherited from [Surface](bb391358-5ca0-578d-e8e2-6d1b30c472d8.md).) |
|  | ToString | Returns a string that represents the current object. (Inherited from Object.) |
  
# Properties

|  | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | [Axis](d477d77b-1381-2cf6-638c-c21553679422.md) | Axis of the cylinder. This is the Z axis of the local coordinate system associated with this cylinder. |
|  | [IsValidObject](6429595a-a6e1-2501-1e60-9c53814a9108.md) | Specifies whether the .NET object represents a valid Revit entity.  (Inherited from [Surface](bb391358-5ca0-578d-e8e2-6d1b30c472d8.md).) |
|  | [OrientationMatchesParametricOrientation](451b549f-2bc4-4f37-9f32-981fe18868a8.md) | Indicates whether this Surface's orientation is the same as or opposite to its parametric orientation.  (Inherited from [Surface](bb391358-5ca0-578d-e8e2-6d1b30c472d8.md).) |
|  | [Origin](fb029049-10fb-0e2c-5216-813ff9b3e6b3.md) | Center of the circle that defines the base of the cylinder. This is the origin of the local coordinate system associated with this cylinder. |
|  | [Radius](66115aa4-0b8f-627f-26a5-b6bf2d6f4f1e.md) | Radius of the circle that defines the base of this cylinder. |
|  | [XDir](6a22ae33-ce30-36e9-6c71-b1a9cb50e858.md) | X axis of the local coordinate system associated with this cylinder. |
|  | [YDir](f2eacbac-50ab-a937-9d95-062e8bc631d9.md) | Y axis of the local coordinate system associated with this cylinder. |
