Determines if this CurveLoop is oriented counter-clockwise (CCW) or clockwise (CW) with respect to the specified 3D direction.

# Syntax

    public bool IsCounterclockwise(

    Public Function IsCounterclockwise ( _
    	normal As [XYZ](c2fd995c-95c0-58fb-f5de-f3246cbc5600.md) _
    ) As Boolean

    public:
    bool IsCounterclockwise(
    	[XYZ](c2fd995c-95c0-58fb-f5de-f3246cbc5600.md)^ normal
    )  
  
#### Parameters

normal
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..XYZ](c2fd995c-95c0-58fb-f5de-f3246cbc5600.md) The normal vector to the plane used for this determination. 

#### Return Value

True if the curve loop is oriented counter-clockwise with respect to the specified 3D direction, false if the loop is oriented clockwise. 

# Remarks

CCW means that the projection of the CurveLoop onto a plane having "normal" as its oriented normal is CCW. This method should only be called if the loop is closed and has a non-singular projection onto the plane (i.e., the projection should have no self-intersections and should not be degenerate or even nearly degenerate). The return value in other cases is indeterminate. 

# Exceptions

| Exception | Condition |
| --- | --- |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions..::..ArgumentNullException](631e1424-60f4-929b-4e52-dda9dcd26316.md) | A non-optional argument was null |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions..::..InvalidOperationException](9e715f03-3884-e539-4dd6-8d7545733adc.md) | The curve loop is open or consists of a single unbound curve; counterclockwise determination has no meaning. |
