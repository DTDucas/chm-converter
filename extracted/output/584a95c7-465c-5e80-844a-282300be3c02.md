|  | [FindAllEdgeEndPointsAtVertex](4a7c822c-3be0-52b6-cdca-3cd6496759c5.md) | Find all EdgeEndPoints at a vertex identified by the input EdgeEndPoint. |
|  | [IsValidForTessellation](a99a8a88-2e90-8d90-60bd-6ee37ab47515.md) | Tests if the input solid or shell is valid for tessellation. |
|  | [SplitVolumes](0ba1e838-c300-ed47-bd2e-7fc3e2dd80d8.md) | Splits a solid geometry into several separate solids. |
