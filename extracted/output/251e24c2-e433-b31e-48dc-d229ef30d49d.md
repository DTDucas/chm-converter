# Methods

|  | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | [AlmostEqual](01045a3f-bb71-32d1-ed8b-34c81548344f.md) | Determines whether this transformation and the specified transformation are the same within the tolerance (1.0e-09). |
|  | [Assign](f12b0bda-b5f8-e67b-3c36-329b21bbf4ff.md) | Assigns values from the input transformation to this transformation. |
|  | [Dispose](a231ae0e-ce21-1433-b42a-d4c96f23d9c6.md) |  |
|  | Equals | Determines whether the specified Object is equal to the current Object. (Inherited from Object.) |
|  | GetHashCode | Serves as a hash function for a particular type.  (Inherited from Object.) |
|  | [GetInverse](823f8360-6333-6449-a748-ad5c58aa4149.md) | Gets the inverse transformation of this transformation. |
|  | GetType | Gets the Type of the current instance. (Inherited from Object.) |
|  | [Multiply](c4be593d-c2b2-0c86-90e3-a92b8d600552.md) | Multiplies this transformation by the specified transformation and returns the result. |
|  | [OfPoint](cc9a6547-a08e-99d0-2970-2b816ed1e579.md) | Applies the transformation to the 1-dimensional point and returns the result. |
|  | [OfVector](9d1500f3-b374-791a-c4e0-d2a2cbfcba44.md) | Applies the transformation to the 1-dimensional vector (a "tangent vector" on the real line) and returns the result. |
|  | [SetToIdentity](2dd1bcb6-d3ad-3440-3040-3501a8d989aa.md) | Set this TrfUV to the identity transform |
|  | ToString | Returns a string that represents the current object. (Inherited from Object.) |
|  | [TransformParameterDomain](fe97e6d2-eea0-26e5-0d32-16281ea95d19.md) | Performs a transform of the parameter range defined by domain, and ensures that the domain is ordered correctly. |
