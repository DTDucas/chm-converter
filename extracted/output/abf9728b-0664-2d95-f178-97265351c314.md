#### Parameters

isSolid
    Type: System..::..BooleanIndicates if the swept blend is Solid or Void.

path
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..Reference](d28155ae-817b-1f31-9c3f-c9c6a28acc0d.md)The path of the swept blend. The path might be a reference of single curve or edge obtained from existing geometry. Or the path can be a single sketched curve, and the curve is not required to reference existing geometry.

bottomProfile
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..SweepProfile](1b77356c-e92b-e151-f8c9-727b3e2b8934.md)The bottom profile of the newly created Swept blend. It should consist of only one curve loop. the input profile must be in one plane.

topProfile
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..SweepProfile](1b77356c-e92b-e151-f8c9-727b3e2b8934.md)The top profile of the newly created Swept blend. It should consist of only one curve loop. The profile must lie in the XY plane, and it will be transformed to the profile plane automatically. 

#### Return Value

If creation was successful the new Swept blend is returned, otherwise an exception with failure information will be thrown.

# Remarks

This method creates a swept blend in a family document. The swept blend will trace from bottom profile to the top along the path. Revit will determine an appropriate default mapping for the vertices of the two profiles. If the input profile is to be a cyclic profile (curve or ellipse) it must be split into at least two segments, so that Revit can find vertices to use for mapping the swept blend.
