    }  
  
# Remarks

Returns the main window handle of the Revit application. This handle should be used when displaying modal dialogs and message windows to insure that they are properly parented. This property replaces System.Diagnostics.Process.GetCurrentProcess().MainWindowHandle property, which is no longer a reliable method of retrieving the main window handle starting with Revit 2019.
