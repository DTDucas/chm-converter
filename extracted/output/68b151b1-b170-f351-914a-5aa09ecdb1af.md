# Syntax

C#

    public static bool IsValidName(
    	string string
    )  
  
Visual Basic

    Public Shared Function IsValidName ( _
    	string As String _
    ) As Boolean  
  
Visual C++  
---  
      
    
    public:
    static bool IsValidName(
    	String^ string
    )  
  
#### Parameters

string
    Type: System..::..String The name to validate. 

#### Return Value

True if the name is valid for use as a name in Revit, false if it contains prohibited characters and is invalid. 

# Remarks

This routine checks only for prohibited characters in the string. When setting the name for an object there are other specific considerations which are checked (for example, the same name cannot be used twice for different elements of the same type). This routine does not check those conditions.
