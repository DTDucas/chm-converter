Returns the state of a tangent join between this and another curve element at the given end-point.

#### Parameters

end
    Type: System..::..Int32 Index of one of the curve's end. Values '0' and '1' indicate the start or end point, respectively. 

other
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..ElementId](44f3f7b1-3229-3404-93c9-dc5e70337dd6.md) ElementId of another Curve Element from the same document. 

#### Return Value

Returns True if this curve element has a tangent joint with the other input element and the join is curently locked; returns False otherwise. 

# Remarks

The return value indicates whether there is such tangent join and if it is currently locked. A negative value indicates that there either is no tangent join with the other element at the given end-point, or the join between those two curve element is not currently locked. 

# Exceptions

| Exception | Condition |
| --- | --- |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions..::..ArgumentException](2e6e4206-97a8-dd4b-df5d-4269f4bb6088.md) | The given Id does not represent any of the two end-points of a curve element. A valid value of either '0' or '1' is expected. -or- The given ElementId (%elementId) is not of a valid Curve Element. A valid Curve Element must be in the same document and must be diferent than this curve elements self. -or- This element has no tangent join with the input element at the given end-point. |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions..::..ArgumentNullException](631e1424-60f4-929b-4e52-dda9dcd26316.md) | A non-optional argument was null |
