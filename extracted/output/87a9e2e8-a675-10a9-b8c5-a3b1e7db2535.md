# Syntax

    bool IsResourceWellFormed(
    	[ExternalResourceReference](ffad9c15-8fc9-fbfd-f328-101533f4cf74.md) extRef

    Function IsResourceWellFormed ( _
    	extRef As [ExternalResourceReference](ffad9c15-8fc9-fbfd-f328-101533f4cf74.md) _
    ) As Boolean

    bool IsResourceWellFormed(
    	[ExternalResourceReference](ffad9c15-8fc9-fbfd-f328-101533f4cf74.md)^ extRef
    )  
  
#### Parameters

extRef
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..ExternalResourceReference](ffad9c15-8fc9-fbfd-f328-101533f4cf74.md) The ExternalResourceReference to check. 

#### Return Value

True if the ExternalResourceReference represents a well-formed resource. False otherwise. 

# Remarks

Different servers will have different requirements.

A server which loads references from a website might require that the reference map contain a key called "URL" and a value that is a valid URL. 

A server which loads references from a network drive might require a key called "Drive" with a value that represents a drive name, plus a key called "Path" with a value that corresponds to a path relative to the root of the drive. 

This function should not check that the resource exists on the server. It should only check that the resource is formatted correctly.
