#### Parameters

middle
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..XYZ](c2fd995c-95c0-58fb-f5de-f3246cbc5600.md)The second vector.

right
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..XYZ](c2fd995c-95c0-58fb-f5de-f3246cbc5600.md)The third vector.

#### Return Value

The real number equal to the triple product.

# Remarks

The scalar triple product is defined as the dot product of one of the vectors with the cross product of the other two. Geometrically, this product is the (signed) volume of the parallelepiped formed by the three vectors given.
