|  | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | [AlmostEqual](149b3851-ba79-c3fa-591e-33496f053962.md) | Determines whether this transformation and the specified transformation are the same within the tolerance (1.0e-09). |
|  | [Assign](5646a58f-270e-aa89-505a-a0f293d76e83.md) | Assigns values from the input transformation to this transformation. |
|  | [CreateIdentity](7035cbd5-61fc-432a-abe9-8ba0200ed4dd.md) | Creates the identity transformation. |
|  | [Dispose](e709cdf9-9203-9272-3c6c-fe5dfa90fbce.md) |  |
|  | Equals | Determines whether the specified Object is equal to the current Object. (Inherited from Object.) |
|  | GetHashCode | Serves as a hash function for a particular type.  (Inherited from Object.) |
|  | [GetInverse](511bce10-cd5b-963e-4f4f-86e2b4e7ed73.md) | Gets the inverse transformation of this transformation. |
|  | GetType | Gets the Type of the current instance. (Inherited from Object.) |
|  | [Multiply](52de67bf-77eb-6065-c702-589319f3cae5.md) | Multiplies this transformation by the specified transformation and returns the result. |
|  | [OfPoint](083f5a56-31c6-e8b7-dc22-cf0f4c25608a.md) | Applies the transformation to the point and returns the result. |
|  | [OfVector](72a66105-55d1-3930-8934-2d46d5dd064d.md) | Applies the transformation to the vector and returns the result. |
|  | [PostScale](4bd89ff0-75cf-f499-e88e-9ff5aaff27fd.md) | Scales both the linear and translational parts of this transformation and returns the result. |
|  | [PreScale](c1f6f144-e9a3-0efb-4d1d-2eba05d849f1.md) | Scales the linear part of this transformation and returns the result. |
|  | [SetToIdentity](fbc7f0fe-3e4c-f2f0-ce2c-478a202cd1e2.md) | Set this TrfUV to the identity transform. |
|  | ToString | Returns a string that represents the current object. (Inherited from Object.) |
|  | [TransformUVDomainIfPossible](977e71c5-7a76-a4ee-5232-f826a00f7471.md) | Transforms an envelope ([BoundingBoxUV](e38a0145-4267-0b3f-0718-adb14e34c94e.md)) for one surface to an envelope for a coincident but differently parameterized surface. |
