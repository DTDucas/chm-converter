# Properties

|  | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | [EndStation](cffc9f55-aad7-6af3-2fcd-2c4499171749.md) | The ending station for creating labels in the set, in Revit internal model units (standard Imperial feet). The default value is null. When null, the station value corresponding to the alignment's [DisplayedEndStation](cfde7e75-8057-a6d2-4493-428a035af8e0.md) is used. |
|  | [HasLeader](5ef84857-1ef1-6287-b5cc-231a314ad0db.md) | Specifies if the label will have a leader. The default value is true. |
|  | [Interval](ea9ccd2c-89fd-0fa1-d179-887a204c78e4.md) | The interval between labels to be created in the set, in Revit internal model units (standard Imperial feet). The default value is null. When null, a predefined interval value will be used, depending on the unit setting for stationing units in the document. For standard imperial, the default is 100 ft. For survey imperial, the default is 100 USft (US survey). For metric, the default is 1000 m. |
|  | [Offset](896fafc5-2e25-8ecb-be66-297e2a46f8b6.md) | The offset of the labels from the alignment, in Revit internal paper space units (standard Imperial feet). A positive offset creates labels to the right of the alignment, a negative - to the left. The default value is null. If null, a predefined offset value will be used, depending on the unit setting for stationing units in the document. For standard imperial, the default is 1/8". For survey imperial, the default is 1/8" (US survey). For metric, the default is 5 mm. |
|  | [StartStation](5c74eaa0-bca8-10a8-a901-78de4111477b.md) | The starting station for creating labels in the set, in Revit internal model units (standard Imperial feet). The default value is null. When null, the station value corresponding to the alignment's [DisplayedStartStation](0a17ad4e-4a52-a955-c1af-882e2123bf49.md) is used. |
|  | [TypeId](5b0dfa5d-bc2f-b097-a8d6-c5e78c569add.md) | Specifies the ElementId of the labels' type. The default value is InvalidElementId. in this case, [CreateSet(Alignment, View, AlignmentStationLabelSetOptions)](bbb3fb20-cbc6-f6aa-cc23-ae7ad73747b3.md) will throw an exception. |
