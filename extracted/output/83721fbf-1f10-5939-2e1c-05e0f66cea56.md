# Methods

|  | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | AddHandler(RoutedEvent, Delegate) | Adds a routed event handler for a specified routed event, adding the handler to the handler collection on the current element.  (Inherited from UIElement.) |
|  | AddHandler(RoutedEvent, Delegate, Boolean) | Adds a routed event handler for a specified routed event, adding the handler to the handler collection on the current element. Specify handledEventsToo as true to have the provided handler be invoked for routed event that had already been marked as handled by another element along the event route.  (Inherited from UIElement.) |
|  | AddToEventRoute | Adds handlers to the specified EventRoute for the current UIElement event handler collection. (Inherited from UIElement.) |
|  | ApplyAnimationClock(DependencyProperty, AnimationClock) | Applies an animation to a specified dependency property on this element. Any existing animations are stopped and replaced with the new animation. (Inherited from UIElement.) |
|  | ApplyAnimationClock(DependencyProperty, AnimationClock, HandoffBehavior) | Applies an animation to a specified dependency property on this element, with the ability to specify what happens if the property already has a running animation. (Inherited from UIElement.) |
|  | ApplyTemplate | Builds the current template's visual tree if necessary, and returns a value that indicates whether the visual tree was rebuilt by this call.  (Inherited from FrameworkElement.) |
|  | Arrange | Positions child elements and determines a size for a UIElement. Parent elements call this method from their ArrangeCore(Rect) implementation (or a WPF framework-level equivalent) to form a recursive layout update. This method constitutes the second pass of a layout update.  (Inherited from UIElement.) |
|  | BeginAnimation(DependencyProperty, AnimationTimeline) | Starts an animation for a specified animated property on this element.  (Inherited from UIElement.) |
|  | BeginAnimation(DependencyProperty, AnimationTimeline, HandoffBehavior) | Starts a specific animation for a specified animated property on this element, with the option of specifying what happens if the property already has a running animation.  (Inherited from UIElement.) |
|  | BeginInit | Starts the initialization process for this element.  (Inherited from FrameworkElement.) |
|  | BeginStoryboard(Storyboard) | Begins the sequence of actions that are contained in the provided storyboard.  (Inherited from FrameworkElement.) |
|  | BeginStoryboard(Storyboard, HandoffBehavior) | Begins the sequence of actions contained in the provided storyboard, with options specified for what should happen if the property is already animated.  (Inherited from FrameworkElement.) |
|  | BeginStoryboard(Storyboard, HandoffBehavior, Boolean) | Begins the sequence of actions contained in the provided storyboard, with specified state for control of the animation after it is started.  (Inherited from FrameworkElement.) |
|  | BringIntoView()()()() | Attempts to bring this element into view, within any scrollable regions it is contained within.  (Inherited from FrameworkElement.) |
|  | BringIntoView(Rect) | Attempts to bring the provided region size of this element into view, within any scrollable regions it is contained within.  (Inherited from FrameworkElement.) |
|  | CaptureMouse | Attempts to force capture of the mouse to this element.  (Inherited from UIElement.) |
|  | CaptureStylus | Attempts to force capture of the stylus to this element.  (Inherited from UIElement.) |
|  | CaptureTouch | Attempts to force capture of a touch to this element. (Inherited from UIElement.) |
|  | CheckAccess | Determines whether the calling thread has access to this DispatcherObject. (Inherited from DispatcherObject.) |
|  | ClearValue(DependencyProperty) | Clears the local value of a property. The property to be cleared is specified by a DependencyProperty identifier.  (Inherited from DependencyObject.) |
|  | ClearValue(DependencyPropertyKey) | Clears the local value of a read-only property. The property to be cleared is specified by a DependencyPropertyKey.  (Inherited from DependencyObject.) |
|  | CoerceValue | Coerces the value of the specified dependency property. This is accomplished by invoking any CoerceValueCallback function specified in property metadata for the dependency property as it exists on the calling DependencyObject. (Inherited from DependencyObject.) |
|  | [Dispose](0547edfb-f6fe-3c29-7e2f-5e271fffb2a3.md) | This method is called if the user explicitly disposes of the object (by calling the Dispose method in other managed languages, or the destructor in C++). |
|  | EndInit | Indicates that the initialization process for the element is complete.  (Inherited from FrameworkElement.) |
|  | Equals | Determines whether a provided DependencyObject is equivalent to the current DependencyObject. (Inherited from DependencyObject.) |
|  | FindCommonVisualAncestor | Returns the common ancestor of two visual objects. (Inherited from Visual.) |
|  | FindName | Finds an element that has the provided identifier name.  (Inherited from FrameworkElement.) |
|  | FindResource | Searches for a resource with the specified key, and throws an exception if the requested resource is not found.  (Inherited from FrameworkElement.) |
|  | Focus | Attempts to set focus to this element.  (Inherited from UIElement.) |
|  | GetAnimationBaseValue | Returns the base property value for the specified property on this element, disregarding any possible animated value from a running or stopped animation.  (Inherited from UIElement.) |
|  | GetBindingExpression | Returns the BindingExpression that represents the binding on the specified property.  (Inherited from FrameworkElement.) |
|  | GetHashCode | Gets a hash code for this DependencyObject. (Inherited from DependencyObject.) |
|  | GetLocalValueEnumerator | Creates a specialized enumerator for determining which dependency properties have locally set values on this DependencyObject.  (Inherited from DependencyObject.) |
|  | GetType | Gets the Type of the current instance. (Inherited from Object.) |
|  | GetValue | Returns the current effective value of a dependency property on this instance of a DependencyObject.  (Inherited from DependencyObject.) |
|  | InputHitTest | Returns the input element within the current element that is at the specified coordinates, relative to the current element's origin.  (Inherited from UIElement.) |
|  | InvalidateArrange | Invalidates the arrange state (layout) for the element. After the invalidation, the element will have its layout updated, which will occur asynchronously unless subsequently forced by UpdateLayout()()()().  (Inherited from UIElement.) |
|  | InvalidateMeasure | Invalidates the measurement state (layout) for the element.  (Inherited from UIElement.) |
|  | InvalidateProperty | Re-evaluates the effective value for the specified dependency property (Inherited from DependencyObject.) |
|  | InvalidateVisual | Invalidates the rendering of the element, and forces a complete new layout pass. OnRender(DrawingContext) is called after the layout cycle is completed.  (Inherited from UIElement.) |
|  | IsAncestorOf | Determines whether the visual object is an ancestor of the descendant visual object. (Inherited from Visual.) |
|  | IsDescendantOf | Determines whether the visual object is a descendant of the ancestor visual object. (Inherited from Visual.) |
|  | Measure | Updates the DesiredSize of a UIElement. Parent elements call this method from their own MeasureCore(Size) implementations to form a recursive layout update. Calling this method constitutes the first pass (the "Measure" pass) of a layout update.  (Inherited from UIElement.) |
|  | MoveFocus | Moves the keyboard focus away from this element and to another element in a provided traversal direction.  (Inherited from FrameworkElement.) |
|  | OnApplyTemplate | When overridden in a derived class, is invoked whenever application code or internal processes call ApplyTemplate()()()(). (Inherited from FrameworkElement.) |
|  | PointFromScreen | Converts a Point in screen coordinates into a Point that represents the current coordinate system of the Visual. (Inherited from Visual.) |
|  | PointToScreen | Converts a Point that represents the current coordinate system of the Visual into a Point in screen coordinates. (Inherited from Visual.) |
|  | PredictFocus | Determines the next element that would receive focus relative to this element for a provided focus movement direction, but does not actually move the focus. (Inherited from FrameworkElement.) |

|  | SetBinding(DependencyProperty, String) | Attaches a binding to this element, based on the provided source property name as a path qualification to the data source.  (Inherited from FrameworkElement.) |
|  | SetCurrentValue | Sets the value of a dependency property without changing its value source.  (Inherited from DependencyObject.) |
|  | SetResourceReference | Searches for a resource with the specified name and sets up a resource reference to it for the specified property.  (Inherited from FrameworkElement.) |
|  | SetValue(DependencyProperty, Object) | Sets the local value of a dependency property, specified by its dependency property identifier.  (Inherited from DependencyObject.) |
|  | SetValue(DependencyPropertyKey, Object) | Sets the local value of a read-only dependency property, specified by the DependencyPropertyKey identifier of the dependency property.  (Inherited from DependencyObject.) |
|  | ShouldSerializeCommandBindings | Returns whether serialization processes should serialize the contents of the CommandBindings property on instances of this class. (Inherited from UIElement.) |
