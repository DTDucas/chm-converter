# Remarks

An instance of this class can be obtained only as an argument passed to interfaces used in the process of failure resolution and is the only available interface to fetch information about failures in a document. While reading from a document during failure processing is allowed, the only way to modify document during failure resolution is via methods provided by this class. After returning from failure processing, the instance of the class is deactivated and cannot be used any longer.
