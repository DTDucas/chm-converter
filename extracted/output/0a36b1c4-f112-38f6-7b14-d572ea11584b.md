# Remarks

The location point objects adds additional functionality to its base location object class. This includes setting the elements location to a specific point and retrieving its rotation around its insertion point. Inplace families do not have a single insertion point and therefore do not have meaningful LocationPoint data.

# Examples

    void LocationInformation(LocationPoint position)
    {
        String prompt = "The selected column location information:";
        prompt += "\nPoint:  (" + position.Point.X + ", "
                + position.Point.Y + ", " + position.Point.Z + ")";
        prompt += "\nRotation: " + position.Rotation;
    
        TaskDialog.Show("Revit",prompt);
    }
    
    bool LocationRotate(Autodesk.Revit.ApplicationServices.Application application, Autodesk.Revit.DB.Element element)
    {
        bool rotated = false;
        LocationPoint location = element.Location as LocationPoint;
