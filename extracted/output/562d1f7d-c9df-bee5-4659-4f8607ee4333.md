# Remarks

This represents one of any number of types, as specified by the [ElectricalAnalyticalNodeType](e8d6a74d-1b0e-5b79-a57b-5dab3e4d2d36.md). Some of those types will have [AnalyticalDistributionNodePropertyData](08a43b98-428c-2bd4-d1c3-fc425563d67e.md) while others will not, and if they do have data they can be downcast to a specific subclass of data to be used.
