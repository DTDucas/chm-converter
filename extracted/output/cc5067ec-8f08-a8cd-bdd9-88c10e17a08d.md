# Syntax

    public bool IsTranslation { get; }

    Public ReadOnly Property IsTranslation As Boolean
    	Get

    public:
    property bool IsTranslation {
    	bool get ();
    }  
  
# Remarks

This property is true if the only effect of transformation is translation. It checks that the basis of the transform is identity. The translation vector may be zero (which would make this an identity transformation) or nonzero (which would make this a non-trivial translation).
