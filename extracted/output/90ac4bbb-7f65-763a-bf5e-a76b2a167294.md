# Remarks

The DisplacementPath is anchored to the DisplacementElement by a reference to a point on an edge of a source element of the DisplacementElement. It is represented by a single line, or a series of jogged lines, originating at the specified point on the displaced element. 

The associated DisplacementElement may have a parent DisplacementElement and this parent may have its own parent DisplacementElement, producing a series of ancestors. The terminal point may be the point's original (un-displaced) location, or the corresponding point on any of the intermediate displaced locations corresponding to these ancestor DisplacementElements.
