  * this method is called outside of view, instance and link begin/end calls but still between OnElementBegin2D/OnElementEnd2D calls
  * this method is never called for annotation elements, i.e. their geometry should be processed in methods OnCurve and OnPolyline

  
| [OnPolymesh](6a060c37-3225-217e-b150-2eaea3a22c29.md "OnPolymesh Method")|  This method is called when a tessellated polymesh of a 3d face is being output.  (Inherited from [IExportContext](7d0dc6df-db0e-6a07-3b42-8dde1bedb3c1.md "IExportContext Interface").)
