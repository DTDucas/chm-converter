    public:
    property double ExtensionBelowTreadBase {
    	double get ();
    	void set (double value);
    }  
  
#### Field Value

0.0 if the stairs run connects with stairs landing or the stairs run doesn't begin with a thread. 

# Remarks

This is useful in cases where the run attaches to the face of a floor opening rather than resting on the surface of the floor. Negative value extends the run's first step below the stairs' base elevation. Positive value trims it above the stairs' base elevation. This value should not be greater than run's top elevation.
