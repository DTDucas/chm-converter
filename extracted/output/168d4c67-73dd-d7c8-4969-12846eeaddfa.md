#### Parameters

location
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..XYZ](c2fd995c-95c0-58fb-f5de-f3246cbc5600.md)The physical location where the instance is to be placed on the specified level.

symbol
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..FamilySymbol](a1acaed0-6a62-4c1d-94f5-4e27ce0923d3.md)A FamilySymbol object that represents the type of the instance that is to be inserted.

host
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..Element](eb16114f-69ea-f4de-0d0d-f7388b105a16.md) A host object into which the instance will be embedded 

level
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..Level](577e5d4e-a558-118c-9dea-3b810b061775.md)A Level object that is used as the base level for the object.

structuralType
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB.Structure..::..StructuralType](0a0a3793-5fce-283d-4953-a137f5593db9.md) If structural then specify the type of the component. 

#### Return Value

If creation was successful then an instance to the new object is returned, otherwise nullNothingnullptra null reference (Nothing in Visual Basic).

# Remarks

This form of NewFamilyInstance is the most commonly used in Autodesk Revit since there are a large number of elements that use levels, such as Walls, Columns etc. If the instance fails to be created an exception may be thrown. 

The type/symbol that is used must be loaded into the document before this method is called. Families and their symbols can be loaded using the Document.LoadFamily or Document.LoadFamilySymbol methods. 

All levels within the document can be found by iterating over the entire document and searching for objects of type Autodesk.Revit.Elements.Level. 

Some Families, such as Beams, have more than one endpoint and are inserted in the same manner as single point instances. Once inserted these linear family instances can have their endpoints changed by using the instance's Element.Location property.

Note: ForbiddenForDynamicUpdateException might be thrown during a dynamic update if the inserted instance establishes a mutual dependency with another structure.

Note: if the created family instance includes nested instances, the API framework will automatically regenerate the document during this method call.

# Examples

    void CreateDoorsInWall(Autodesk.Revit.DB.Document document, Wall wall)
    {
        // get wall's level for door creation
        Level level = document.GetElement(wall.LevelId) as Level;
    
        FilteredElementCollector collector = new FilteredElementCollector(document);
        ICollection<Element> collection = collector.OfClass(typeof(FamilySymbol))
                                                   .OfCategory(BuiltInCategory.OST_Doors)
