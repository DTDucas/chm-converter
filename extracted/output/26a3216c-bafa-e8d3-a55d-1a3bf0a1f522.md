    Public Property BeginsWithRiser As Boolean
    	Get
    	Set  
  
Visual C++

    public:
    property bool BeginsWithRiser {
    	bool get ();
    	void set (bool value);
    }  
  
# Remarks

If selected, Revit adds a riser to the beginning of the run. If you clear this option, Revit removes the beginning riser and positions the adjacent tread at the base elevation. Clearing this option will change the number of risers in the run. You will need to manually add a riser to maintain the original height.
