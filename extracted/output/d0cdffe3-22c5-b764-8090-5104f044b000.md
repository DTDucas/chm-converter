| Member name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| None | Represents a failure-free state of a document. This value cannot be used as an argument to construct FailureMesasage. |
| Warning | Failure that can be ignored by end-user. Failures of this severity do not prevent transactions from being committed. |
| Error | Failure that cannot be ignored. If FailureMeassage of this severity is posted, the current transaction cannot be committed unless failure is resolved via appropriate FailureResolution. |
| DocumentCorruption | Failure that forces Transaction to be rolled back as soon as possible due to known corruption to a document. When failure of this severity is posted, reading of information from a document is not allowed. The current transaction has to be rolled back first in order to work with the document. |
