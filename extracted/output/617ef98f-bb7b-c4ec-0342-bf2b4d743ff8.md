#### Parameters

document
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..Document](db03274b-a107-aa32-9034-f3e0df4bb1ec.md) The document. 

stairsId
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..ElementId](44f3f7b1-3229-3404-93c9-dc5e70337dd6.md) The stairs that the new stairs run will belong to. 

baseElevation
    Type: System..::..Double Base elevation of the new stairs run. It has following restrictions: 

  * The base elevation is relative to the base elevation of the stairs.
  * The base elevation will be rounded automatically to a multiple of the riser height.



boundaryCurves
    Type: System.Collections.Generic..::..IList<(Of <(<'[SketchedStairsCurveData](db3920d1-6efe-0ed4-f951-4d69c254cc6c.md)>)>)> The boundary curves of the new stairs run, specifying slope type and height. The curves have following restriction: 

  * The curves should consist of bound Line or Arc curves only.
  * The curves should be a pair of curve chains(two sets of curves which connect end-to-end to form the left and right boundaries).
  * The left and right boundary chain curves should not connect to each other.
  * They can be single curves or multi-segmented curves(for example, straight lines and arcs connected).



riserCurves
    Type: System.Collections.Generic..::..IList<(Of <(<'[Curve](400cc9b6-9ff7-de85-6fd8-c20002209d25.md)>)>)> The riser curves of the new stairs run. The curves have following restriction: 

  * The curves should consist of bound Line or Arc curves only.
  * The curves should be able to make at least two curve chains.
  * The curves in each chain should connect between the left and right boundaries.



stairsPath
    Type: System.Collections.Generic..::..IList<(Of <(<'[Curve](400cc9b6-9ff7-de85-6fd8-c20002209d25.md)>)>)> The stair path curves of the new stairs run. The curves have following restriction: 

  * The curves should consist of bound Line or Arc curves only.
  * The curves should be able to make one curve chain.
  * The curve chain should have intersection with all riser curve chains.
  * The curves should connect between the first and last riser chain curves.



#### Return Value

The new stairs run. 

# Remarks

The run type of the new stairs run will be determined by the specified stairs. The new stairs run and the document will be regenerated. This should be run from within an open transaction.
