# Members
| Member name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| --- | --- |
| All | System calculation is on for everything (with every bit being 1) |
| None | System calculation is off |
| Flow | System calculation is only for flow |
| Volume | This mode is obsoleted in Revit 2017. |
| Performance | This mode is reserved for limiting the system propagation and other performance-boosting options. Note that the system-related functionalities might be traded off for faster layout capability in large system when this mode is on. Be careful that this mode is NOT included in the "All" mode. |
