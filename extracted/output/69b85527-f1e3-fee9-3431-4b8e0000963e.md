#### Parameters

dBView
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..View](fb92a4e7-f3a7-ef14-e631-342179b18de9.md) The view where rendering will occur. If this argument is nullNothingnullptra null reference (Nothing in Visual Basic), a view-independent bounding box should be reported. 

#### Return Value

The bounding box as an Outline. 

# Remarks

Revit uses the bounding box when navigating views, e.g., when a Zoom to Fit command is issued. The reported bounding box does not have to be tight. However, there may be unintended side-effects if the box is inconsistent with the submitted geometry.
