#### Field Value

The ID of the field, or InvalidElementId. 

# Remarks

A Percentage field calculates what percent of the total of another field each element represents. PercentageOf is the ID of the field used to calculate percentages. If PercentageOf is InvalidScheduleFieldId, no data is displayed.

Percentages can only be calculated for numeric fields. The Count field and other percentage fields cannot be used to calculate percentages.
