**Namespace:** [Autodesk.Revit.DB](87546ba7-461b-c646-cbb1-2cb8f5bff8b2.md)**Assembly:** RevitAPI (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 24.0.0.0 (24.0.0.0)**Since:** 2014 

# Syntax

C#  
---  
      
    
    public bool SuppressTrailingZeros { get; set; }  
  
Visual Basic  
---  
      
    
    Public Property SuppressTrailingZeros As Boolean
    	Get
    	Set  
  
Visual C++  
---  
      
    
    public:
    property bool SuppressTrailingZeros {
    	bool get ();
    	void set (bool value);
    }  
  
#### Field Value

True if trailing zeros should be suppressed, false otherwise. The default is false. 

# Remarks

This property is applicable to display units which are formatted as a decimal number. It is not applicable to the following display units which have specialized formatting:

  * DUT_GENERAL
  * DUT_FEET_FRACTIONAL_INCHES
  * DUT_FRACTIONAL_INCHES
  * DUT_METERS_CENTIMETERS
  * DUT_DEGREES_AND_MINUTES
  * DUT_RISE_OVER_INCHES
  * DUT_RISE_OVER_120_INCHES
  * DUT_RISE_OVER_FOOT
  * DUT_RISE_OVER_10_FEET



When SuppressTrailingZeros is true, trailing zeros to the right of the decimal point will not be displayed. For example, 1.200 will be displayed as 1.2.

Trailing zeros are always suppressed for DUT_GENERAL, and the SuppressTrailingZeros property is not used.
