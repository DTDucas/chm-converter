#### Parameters

node
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..InstanceNode](4f7fbd19-9a61-c173-2b4f-9c0be9e550bb.md)

#### Return Value

Return RenderNodeAction.Skip if you wish to skip processing this family instance, or return RenderNodeAction.Proceed otherwise.

    /// This method marks the start of processing of an Instance node (e.g. a family instance).
    /// </summary>

       FamilySymbol famSymbol = m_document.GetElement(symbolId) as FamilySymbol;
    
       // Typically, an export context has to manage a stack of transformation
       // for all nested objects, such as instances, lights, links, etc.
       // A combined transformation needs to be applied to the incoming geometry
       // (providing all geometry is to be flattened in the resultant format.)
       m_TransformationStack.Push(m_TransformationStack.Peek().Multiply(node.GetTransform()));
    
       // We can either skip this instance or proceed with rendering it.
       return RenderNodeAction.Proceed;
    }
