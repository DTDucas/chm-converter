# Remarks

When its LoadResource() method is invoked, an IExternalResourceServer can indicate the version of the data that it is providing to Revit by setting this property. Doing so will improve performance, because Revit will use the version information to avoid unnecessary reloads.

See [GetResourceVersionStatus(ExternalResourceReference)](e5699493-c827-d7ba-151c-8d9cdbf894ba.md).
