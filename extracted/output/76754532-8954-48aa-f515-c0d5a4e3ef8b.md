#### Parameters

lightShape
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB.Lighting..::..LightShape](6fc9d0d9-21ac-9192-0178-115be3a48dc7.md) An instance of an object derived from LightShape 

# Remarks

The argument object is cloned. Light shape is a family element parameter. All other LightType properties and methods except for light distribution are family type parameters. Changes to family type parameters may not be committed in the same transaction with changes to family element parameters, otherwise the modifications to the family type may be lost. Always use a separate transaction for changes to the shape and distribution of a light.
