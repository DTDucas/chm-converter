The [NurbsSurfaceData](7d65dbde-8aac-7d7d-e811-a6c91a541de4.md) type exposes the following members.

# Methods

|  | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | [Create](94b4c433-5458-d1ab-d5c9-f526f288d1ff.md) | Construct NurbsSurfaceData based on NURBS surface data, where the weights are supplied. The NURBS surface will be (piecewise) polynomial if all the weights are equal, rational if not. Note: A rational polynomial is a quotient of two polynomials; this includes a polynomial, which can be thought of as a quotient with denominator equal to 1. |
|  | [Dispose](27a918fc-a321-7712-4594-9dd7eb2d2140.md) |  |
|  | Equals | Determines whether the specified Object is equal to the current Object. (Inherited from Object.) |
|  | [GetControlPoints](409fe43e-03a5-b9d6-5bf4-4f6427e3606e.md) | Get the list of control points. |
|  | GetHashCode | Serves as a hash function for a particular type.  (Inherited from Object.) |
|  | [GetKnotsU](e280fd98-bad6-3fb3-547f-a829ab23a9de.md) | Get the list of knots in the u-direction. |
|  | [GetKnotsV](1b0fea7f-4fd0-bee4-cc1b-773b13b2e36b.md) | Get the list of knots in the v-direction. |
|  | GetType | Gets the Type of the current instance. (Inherited from Object.) |
|  | [GetWeights](a1eec836-1db9-00ef-98eb-923c6a77a952.md) | Get the list of weights. |
|  | [IsValid](6ca835bb-02f9-fe37-01ef-618310cef5ab.md) | Check if the object contains a valid NurbsSurfaceData. |
|  | ToString | Returns a string that represents the current object. (Inherited from Object.) |
