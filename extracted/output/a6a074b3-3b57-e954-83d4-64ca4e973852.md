#### Return Value

The short name of the server. 

# Remarks

The name is a unique path prefix included in full paths to external resources provided by this server. It is recommended that the short name length is at least 3 characters to make it useful for users to identify the server easily. 

To ensure the server can be registered successfully, the name should match restrictions below:

  * The name cannot be empty or consist of only whitespace characters.
  * The name should not include any invalid characters such as \/:*?"<>|.
  * The name cannot duplicate any other external resource server names.
  * The name should not duplicate a Revit reserved path prefix(case insensitive), including: RSN, A360, buzzsaw, vault, redspark, ftp, http, https, files, file.
