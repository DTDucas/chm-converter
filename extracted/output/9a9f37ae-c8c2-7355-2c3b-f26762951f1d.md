IExportContext..::..OnFaceBegin Method   
[IExportContext Interface](7d0dc6df-db0e-6a07-3b42-8dde1bedb3c1.md "IExportContext Interface") Example See Also  
---  
This method marks the beginning of a Face to be exported. 
**Namespace:** [Autodesk.Revit.DB](87546ba7-461b-c646-cbb1-2cb8f5bff8b2.md "Autodesk.Revit.DB Namespace")**Assembly:** RevitAPI (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 24.0.0.0 (24.0.0.0)**Since:** 2014 
# Syntax
C#

```text
RenderNodeAction OnFaceBegin(
	FaceNode node
)
```
  
Visual Basic  
---  
```text
Function OnFaceBegin ( _
	node As FaceNode _
) As RenderNodeAction

# ### Parameters
node
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..FaceNode](fbd0d7af-ac40-e81e-8e06-8b2ce90be28b.md "FaceNode Class") An output node that represents a Face. 
# ### Return Value
Return RenderNodeAction. Proceed if you wish to receive geometry (polymesh) for this face, or return RenderNodeAction.Skip otherwise. 
# Remarks
Note that this method (as well as OnFaceEnd) is invoked only if the custom exporter was set up to include geometric objects in the output stream. See [IncludeGeometricObjects](2ce1075e-380e-01e7-6459-b7467c2a2414.md "IncludeGeometricObjects Property") for mode details.

   // whether our export process can handle face geometry or not. If we choose 
   // to proceed, we get calls to export tessellated meshes for this face.
