# Properties

|  | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | [SlabShapeEditFailed](7dfc3f44-6ced-da57-15c6-8d848f8ee23d.md) | Slab Shape Edit failed. [Description] |
|  | [SlabShapeEditFailedError](bbebe17c-106c-8524-e7de-0a9723c4a8f2.md) | Slab Shape Edit failed. [Description] |
|  | [SlabShapeFailedNotHorz](a0a3e030-f72a-dbf6-edc9-d2f79dacba4b.md) | The Floor or Roof or Toposolid is no longer horizontal. |
|  | [SlabShapeFailedNotOnlyLines](c13ea66e-04ca-1d92-bf02-d50f41f5ccb0.md) | The Floor or Roof or Toposolid may only contain straight lines. |
|  | [SlabShapeFailedTooThin](a2155489-a4ba-ce23-06b6-872e1a59547b.md) | The Floor or Roof or Toposolid is too thin for its given type. |
|  | [SlabShapeWarnVerticesCoincident](c2162757-de0a-e366-b880-b5fe6d2c28fe.md) | Some slab shape edit vertices were too close to each other or too close to an edge. |
|  | [SlabShapeWarnVerticesDeleted](ecf0a97a-e674-152a-3f5b-f300dcbb983a.md) | Some slab shape edit vertices were deleted because the Floor or Roof or Toposolid has changed its shape. |
|  | [SlopedInnerEdge](213ad957-af1a-6548-a1d8-44171a53b421.md) | Inner loops of a footprint sketch may not have slope-defining lines. |
|  | [SlopeTailInsideSlopeLine](78569147-0d22-e782-db88-c6ac20692e4a.md) | The tails of slope arrows must not lie in interior of slope defining lines. |
|  | [SlopeZero](21d374b5-0e26-92bc-a73a-eb4df07d6fa1.md) | Adjusting this Line's Overhang will not affect its height because its slope is zero. |
