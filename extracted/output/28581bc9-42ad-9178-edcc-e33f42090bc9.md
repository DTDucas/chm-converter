# Remarks

This filter is a quick filter. Quick filters operate only on the ElementRecord, a low-memory class which has a limited interface to read element properties. Elements which are rejected by a quick filter will not be expanded in memory. 

# Examples

CopyC#
    
    
    // Use Exclusion filter to find exclude a set of elements in the document automatically 
    
    // Find all walls that are not currently selected, 
    // Get all element ids which are current selected by users, exclude these ids when filtering
    ICollection<ElementId> selectedIds = uiDocument.Selection.GetElementIds();
    
    // Use the selection to instantiate an exclusion filter
    ExclusionFilter filter = new ExclusionFilter(selectedIds);
    // For the sake of simplicity we do not test here whether the selection is empty or not,
    // but in production code a proper validation would have to be done to avoid an argument
    // exception from the filter's consructor.
    
    // Apply the filter to the elements in the active document,
    // Use shortcut method OfClass() to find Walls only
    FilteredElementCollector collector = new FilteredElementCollector(uiDocument.Document);
    IList<Element> walls = collector.WherePasses(filter).OfClass(typeof(Wall)).ToElements();
