Indicates if it is possible to create parts from this DirectShape element. 

**Namespace:** [Autodesk.Revit.DB](87546ba7-461b-c646-cbb1-2cb8f5bff8b2.md)**Assembly:** RevitAPI (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 24.0.0.0 (24.0.0.0)**Since:** 2020 

# Syntax

    public bool CanCreateParts()

    Public Function CanCreateParts As Boolean

    public:
    bool CanCreateParts()  
  
#### Return Value

True if it is possible to create parts from this DirectShape. 

# Remarks

While it is generally possible to create parts from DirectShape elements, some characteristics make parts creation impossible. This property is re-evaluated every time the element's geometry is modified (via a call to SetShape or AppendShape). Invalid configurations include: DirectShape elements containing a polymesh, or an open geometry, as well as DirectShape elements not containing any solids and DirectShape elements configured as NotReferenceable (via a call to SetOptions). Finally, if a DirectShape element has DirectShapeType instances in its geometry, and one of those DirectShapeTypes has a configuration that is incompatible with parts creation, the DirectShape element will also be incompatible with parts creation.
