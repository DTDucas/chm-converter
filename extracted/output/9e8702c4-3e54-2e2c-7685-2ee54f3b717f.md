# Properties
| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [IncorrectWallUsageWithAttachedStruct](d0687084-5388-60d1-dc22-9b2268b1b449.md "IncorrectWallUsageWithAttachedStruct Property") | A structural framing element is attached to a wall whose Structural Usage is set to [Usage]. |
| [InvalidWorkplaneForStructuralFraming](09068ede-0610-41c7-bc37-e71be67c6bc3.md "InvalidWorkplaneForStructuralFraming Property") | Workplane not valid for Structural Framing component "[Family Name]" |
| [RemoveTrussSketch](d9d159c0-0aed-af88-b46e-2a6fd251fb13.md "RemoveTrussSketch Property") | Remove Sketch |
| [TrussBadTransformation](671ef31b-9475-30e0-dc03-cf33b4cf3e8c.md "TrussBadTransformation Property") | Revit cannot transform the truss Layout Family to the Truss as oriented in the project. |
| [TrussChordUntransformable](cdfd61d2-1a2f-72e5-b742-fa5909dbdae1.md "TrussChordUntransformable Property") | Unable to maintain user changes to unpinned Chord. Restoring Truss-defined shape. |
| [TrussDuplicateEngineeringType](9f59960a-bf96-8e42-fdbb-362728f61208.md "TrussDuplicateEngineeringType Property") | Elements have duplicate 'Engineering Type' values. |
| [TrussInvalidSymbolGeom](6f785510-5d44-5efc-f093-1a5030a85daa.md "TrussInvalidSymbolGeom Property") | Truss is unable to generate any members due to layout family error. |
| [TrussIsAttachedTo](3664190b-2c58-dbf7-51a9-39bdb5d9afcd.md "TrussIsAttachedTo Property") | Revit cannot attach to the chosen Roof/Slab. The truss cannot project to a surface or the attachment creates an invalid profile. |
| [TrussLayoutNonSympleTopChord](7f31a2b9-8d1c-23af-3877-7566c21d70ef.md "TrussLayoutNonSympleTopChord Property") | This truss layout family defines an offset or non horizontal top chord. This may conflict with attachment or profile editing. |
| [TrussLayoutOverlapedCurves](dcd23393-04f4-71a4-01e5-89e0b0239e55.md "TrussLayoutOverlapedCurves Property") | The current transformation of this specific truss layout will some sub members to overlap. |
| [TrussNotJoinedWebs](00abe21f-ebd1-edd7-e05c-4f4515b3cbb7.md "TrussNotJoinedWebs Property") | The current edits are causing some webs to disjoin. The truss layout family requires additional constraints to maintain these joins. |
| [TrussUserDefinedMemberDeleted](9c5cf96a-abb9-c4e0-4a5a-7a608f8f7b6f.md "TrussUserDefinedMemberDeleted Property") | A user-defined structural member was deleted due to missing or deleted references. |
| [TrussUserDefinedMemberNotJoined](17459bde-eba2-d87b-be07-fdb15a5f22d9.md "TrussUserDefinedMemberNotJoined Property") | Both start and end of web must intersect the truss. |
