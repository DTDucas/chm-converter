# Properties

|  | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | [AllowVerticalOffsetOfBReps](903dec76-11dd-2302-4a93-e6ea12910f26.md) | Allows vertical shifting of breps when moving towards the origin. |
|  | [AreInnerRegionsOpenings](5f33204d-6147-d044-2e34-bb9f3168a2b6.md) | True if inner regions of the extrusion should become openings, false otherwise. |
|  | [CustomAxis](080c7d43-0546-b996-b0f1-6ca0ad79bc53.md) | The custom extrusion axis to try when generating an extrusion. |
|  | [ExtrusionDirection](5f5c831f-f0dd-f46a-028c-dd0d6ac09123.md) | The extrusion direction to generate an extrusion. |
|  | [ForceOffset](f30370e6-0b0f-2e41-ac1e-d54fa189c672.md) | True to create new local placement with identity transform. |
|  | [HasCustomAxis](c40ae541-f0bc-fc8d-3fa8-5a40a5183d34.md) | Identifies if the data contains a custom extrusion axis. |
|  | [HasExtrusionDirection](7b1c95e7-5d86-5151-9969-0beaf98b7d89.md) | Identifies if the data contains a extrusion direction. |
