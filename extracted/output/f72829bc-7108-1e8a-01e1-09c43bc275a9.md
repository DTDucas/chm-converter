#### Parameters

profileLoops
    Type: System.Collections.Generic..::..IList<(Of <(<'[CurveLoop](84824924-cb89-9e20-de6e-3461f429dfd6.md)>)>)> The profile loops to be extruded. The loops must be closed, coplanar, and without intersections, self-intersections, or degeneracies. No loop may contain just one closed curve - split such loops into two or more curves beforehand. No conditions are imposed on the orientations of the loops: this function will use copies of the input loops that have been oriented as necessary to conform to Revit's orientation conventions. 

extrusionDir
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..XYZ](c2fd995c-95c0-58fb-f5de-f3246cbc5600.md) The direction in which to extrude the profile loops. This vector must be non-zero and transverse (i.e., not parallel) to the plane of the profile loops. Its length is irrelevant; only its direction is used. 

extrusionDist
    Type: System..::..Double The positive distance by which the loops are to be extruded in the direction of the input extrusionDir. 

solidOptions
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..SolidOptions](75d6caeb-62d1-d31f-47fe-618ac7cedf19.md) The optional information to control the properties of the Solid. 

#### Return Value

The requested solid. 

# Exceptions

| Exception | Condition |
| --- | --- |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions..::..ArgumentException](2e6e4206-97a8-dd4b-df5d-4269f4bb6088.md) | The profile CurveLoops do not satisfy the input requirements. -or- The Input extrusionDir must be a non-zero vector. The normal of the loop plane should not be perpendicular to the given extrusionDir. -or- The input argument extrusionDist must be positive. |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions..::..ArgumentNullException](631e1424-60f4-929b-4e52-dda9dcd26316.md) | A non-optional argument was null |
