#### Parameters

serverId
    Type: System..::..Guid Id of the server. 

document
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..Document](db03274b-a107-aa32-9034-f3e0df4bb1ec.md) The document for which the server is being set as active. 

# Remarks

Only one server per document can be set as active at any given time in a single-server service. A document does not have to have an explicitly set active server though - the application-wide active server would be normally used when the service is executed for such a document. 

Having an active server for a document overrules the active server set for the application. That means if the service gets executed in this particular document, the document-specific server will be used instead of the application-wide one. 

For a service which has cref="Autodesk::Revit::DB::ExternalService::SupportActivation" set to true it is possible to set a server as active when another server is already active for that service in this document. Making a server active will automatically deactivate the server that was active before this call. 

For a service which has cref="Autodesk::Revit::DB::ExternalService::SupportActivation" set to false calling this method will throw exception. For this kind of service only one server can be added, and it will be marked by default as an application-wide active server.
