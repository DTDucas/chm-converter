|  | [GetHashCode](08e8412d-4002-22a5-858d-f55eba1bed34.md) | Gets the integer value of the geometry object as hash code  (Inherited from [GeometryObject](e0f15010-0e19-6216-e2f0-ab7978145daa.md).) |
|  | [GetRegions](9bde5f26-f830-7fca-39aa-792f9ac7caa5.md) | Gets the face regions (created, for example, by the Split Face command) of the face. |
|  | [GetSurface](c8d124ed-1e6e-d08c-3e4b-b37c4bc2890b.md) | Returns a copy of this face's surface. |
|  | GetType | Gets the Type of the current instance. (Inherited from Object.) |
|  | [Intersect(Curve)](9a487e3d-bbb4-34b9-307d-2e4f63fddab6.md) | Calculates the intersection of the specified curve with this face. |
|  | [Intersect(Face)](91f650a2-bb95-650b-7c00-d431fa613753.md) | Calculates the intersection of the specified face with this face and returns the intersection results. |

|  | [IsInside(UV)](76c639c2-ddce-f010-f81a-bd59e46cc5e1.md) | Indicates whether the specified point is within this face. |
|  | [IsInside(UV, IntersectionResult%)](646e7606-b2e6-b3cc-d808-e4b157e5ffa7.md) | Indicates whether the specified point is within this face and outputs additional information about the point location. |
|  | [Project](4bee3e30-74fa-3103-c2f4-d07618fbcedf.md) | Projects the specified point on the face. |
|  | ToString | Returns a string that represents the current object. (Inherited from Object.) |
