# Methods
| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [AddSubTag](c8bf3c16-6864-8323-3c57-c132e9282473.md "AddSubTag Method") | Adds a correspondence between an ExternalGeometryId and a BRepBuilderGeometryId. Note that an existing correspondence in the map cannot be updated and that a particular BRepBuilderGeometryId may be related to at most one ExternalGeometryId. |
| [Dispose](73d61523-7280-b04d-480f-9ae04a9373af.md "Dispose Method") |
| Equals | Determines whether the specified Object is equal to the current Object. (Inherited from Object.) |
| GetHashCode | Serves as a hash function for a particular type.  (Inherited from Object.) |
| GetType | Gets the Type of the current instance. (Inherited from Object.) |
| [IsAssociatedBRepBuilderValid](817496ab-6542-91cf-247d-6455add3df09.md "IsAssociatedBRepBuilderValid Method") | Validates the associated (in the constructor) BRepBuilder for this BRepBuilderPersistentIds. |
| [IsBRepBuilderGeometryIdFaceOrEdge](22fae990-9618-4ea0-3fc7-775000c40a94.md "IsBRepBuilderGeometryIdFaceOrEdge Method") | Validates the input BRepBuilderGeometryId that will be used to create a correspondence. In order to be valid, the input BRepBuilderGeometryId must represent the ID of either a Face or an Edge. |
| [IsValidBRepBuilderGeometryIdForNewCorrespondence](1d7e2823-e05b-2519-a55b-1b3075744497.md "IsValidBRepBuilderGeometryIdForNewCorrespondence Method") | Validates the input BRepBuilderGeometryId that will be used to create a correspondence. In order to be valid, a correspondence for the input BRepBuilderGeometryId must not already exist. |
| [IsValidExternalGeometryIdForNewCorrespondence](634779e5-d3d2-c68c-ccc8-07731fe44486.md "IsValidExternalGeometryIdForNewCorrespondence Method") | Validates the input ExternalGeometryId that will be used to create a correspondence. In order to be valid, a correspondence for the input ExternalGeometryId must not already exist. |
| ToString | Returns a string that represents the current object. (Inherited from Object.) |
