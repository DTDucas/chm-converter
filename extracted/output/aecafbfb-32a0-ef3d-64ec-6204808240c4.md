# Properties

|  | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | [CutoffHeight](50227765-fb72-587a-38aa-0559877a790f.md) | Horizontal segments below or at the cutoff height have their distance to the wall bottom fixed, those above have their distance to the wall top fixed. |
|  | [EndCap](545d437e-a6b3-bfcb-97c2-d16106669744.md) | Indicates the end cap condition defining which shell layers will participate in end wrapping. |
|  | [HasStructuralDeck](0a185ddd-e618-7b5b-ba1d-6d659ae79d7d.md) | Checks if the compound structure has a structural deck. |
|  | [IsEmpty](83b951b2-dadd-ac46-82e6-40003a29403e.md) | Checks whether this CompoundStructure is empty. |
|  | [IsValidObject](8b536d01-26ab-721a-9047-db61124ecef0.md) | Specifies whether the .NET object represents a valid Revit entity. |
|  | [IsVerticallyCompound](cd352f22-8ca4-b3b6-f247-d9865a91bb6f.md) | Identifies if this CompoundStructure represents a layout that is more complicated than a simple set of parallel layers. |
|  | [LayerCount](8598a249-81da-128f-8629-0bcb2c8f3c3c.md) | Returns the number of layers contained in this CompoundStructure. |
|  | [MinimumSampleHeight](fe47d724-5e94-dc16-903b-3f2dc51e3c56.md) | The minimum sample height determined by the current sample height and the horizontal segments. |
|  | [OpeningWrapping](f13813ad-738a-9cd3-2fad-02aba0c0b5f9.md) | Indicates the opening wrapping condition defining which shell layers of a wall, in plan view, wrap at inserts and openings. |
|  | [SampleHeight](8b60783a-a146-a498-0d92-3d5e55dab34e.md) | The sample height is the presumed height of the wall to which the data in this CompoundStructure is applied. |
|  | [StructuralMaterialIndex](cf4d771e-6ed2-ec6a-d32d-647fb5b649b3.md) | Indicates the layer whose material defines the structural properties of the type for the purposes of analysis. |
|  | [VariableLayerIndex](e93ce781-df22-cc64-7ad8-70a0d6bc7707.md) | Indicates the index of the layer which is designated as variable. |
