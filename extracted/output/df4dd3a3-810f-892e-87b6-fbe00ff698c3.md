# ### Return Value
3D curve lying in the XY plane in XYZ coordinates, representing the 2D curve with its UV coordinates identified with XY coordinates. 
# Remarks
Ideally, this function should only be used in cases when the 2D curve needs to be used in a context that does not support 2D curves, but can represent them as 3D curves with Z = 0 everywhere (for example, converting the 2D curve to another CAD system that does not support 2D curves).
