Sets a new distribution path to be applied to the rebar. This information is set to the rebar after the API execution is finished successfully.

    public void SetDistributionPath(
    	IList<[Curve](400cc9b6-9ff7-de85-6fd8-c20002209d25.md)> path
    )

    Public Sub SetDistributionPath ( _
    	path As IList(Of [Curve](400cc9b6-9ff7-de85-6fd8-c20002209d25.md)) _
    )

    public:
    void SetDistributionPath(
    	IList<[Curve](400cc9b6-9ff7-de85-6fd8-c20002209d25.md)^>^ path
    )  
  
#### Parameters

path
    Type: System.Collections.Generic..::..IList<(Of <(<'[Curve](400cc9b6-9ff7-de85-6fd8-c20002209d25.md)>)>)> Input curves that describe the new path. 

# Remarks

For a free form rebar set the distance between two consecutive bars may be different if it is calculated between different points on bars. The distribution path is an array of curves with the property that based on these curves the set was calculated to respect the layout rule and number of bars or spacing.
