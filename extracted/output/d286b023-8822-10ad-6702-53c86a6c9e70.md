# Syntax

    public class AnalyticalModelSelector : IDisposable  
  
Visual Basic

    Public Class AnalyticalModelSelector _

    public ref class AnalyticalModelSelector : IDisposable  
  
# Remarks

This is used to identify the portion of an analytical model of interest to a client. To identify the portion of the analytical model, the client must identify the curve in question, by using one of the following: 

  * The specific curve within the analytical model.
  * The index of the curve within the analytical model.

If a specific part of that curve is of interest, the client needs to identify that by specifying one of the following: 
  * The start of the curve.
  * The end of the curve.
  * The entire curve. This is the default behavior, so this does not need specifying.
