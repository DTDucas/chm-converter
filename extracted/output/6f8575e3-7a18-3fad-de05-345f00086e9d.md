The [CurveUV](2d1d9c1f-afb6-fc09-f461-54cf0d511bf0.md) type exposes the following members.

# Methods

|  | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | [As3DCurveInXYPlane](df4dd3a3-810f-892e-87b6-fbe00ff698c3.md) | Returns a 3D curve lying in the XY plane in XYZ coordinates, representing the 2D curve with its UV coordinates identified with XY coordinates. |
|  | [ComputeDerivatives](ed10dba7-d0e6-fc6f-9cf6-f1e28946eb2f.md) | Computes the first derivative, the second derivative and the unit tangent vector at the specified parameter along the curve. |
|  | [Create](64c3ccbc-ae7d-e9a8-d487-aab04f6143a5.md) | Create a CurveUV from a bounded 3D Curve lying in the XY plane. |
|  | [Dispose](0517da08-6208-a7ee-f78a-5e7bd7cb16e5.md) |  |
|  | Equals | Determines whether the specified Object is equal to the current Object. (Inherited from Object.) |
|  | [Evaluate](ea7d15ea-e248-e217-2900-662be2e4d274.md) | Evaluates and returns the point at the specified parameter along the curve. |
|  | [GetEndParameter](daa1ae74-36c8-fcfb-48d9-d9040df6d54f.md) | Gets the raw parameter value at the start or end of this curve. |
|  | GetHashCode | Serves as a hash function for a particular type.  (Inherited from Object.) |
|  | GetType | Gets the Type of the current instance. (Inherited from Object.) |
|  | ToString | Returns a string that represents the current object. (Inherited from Object.) |
|  | [Transform](628d9276-4912-58c8-8601-5f6b5266158c.md) | Transform this CurveUV by the given 2D affine transform if possible. |
