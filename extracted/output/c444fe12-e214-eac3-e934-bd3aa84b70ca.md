# Remarks
An instance of this interface should be created by the engine provider and registered with the PointCloudEnginesRegistry. The engine may associated with a particular file name extension during registration (for example, Revit supplies a built-in engine for working with files with the extension "rcs" or "rcp"). Alternatively, the engine may be associated with an identifier which is not expected to the be the extension of a particular file.
