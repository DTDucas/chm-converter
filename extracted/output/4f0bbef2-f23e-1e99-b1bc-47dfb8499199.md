The [HermiteSurface](55ff0501-286a-79d6-0530-b34ce6ce09af.md) type exposes the following members.

# Methods

|  | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | [Create(Int32, Int32, IList<(Of <<'(XYZ>)>>))](cf4eb83b-5e6a-8f36-7c24-b215815b850b.md) | Create a non-periodic Hermite surface using a net of 3D points as input. |
|  | [Create(Int32, Int32, IList<(Of <<'(XYZ>)>>), Boolean, Boolean)](e4480853-0cfd-3856-d931-a0b456a09fe5.md) | Create a Hermite surface using a net of 3D points as input. Specify periodicity in U and V direction. |
|  | [Dispose](c9ee1344-bc19-d833-52e7-dcc4931fe085.md) | (Inherited from [Surface](bb391358-5ca0-578d-e8e2-6d1b30c472d8.md).) |
|  | Equals | Determines whether the specified Object is equal to the current Object. (Inherited from Object.) |
|  | [GetBoundingBoxUV](5084214f-219f-780f-fe03-f16b62b2660d.md) | Gets the UV bounding box of the surface.  (Inherited from [Surface](bb391358-5ca0-578d-e8e2-6d1b30c472d8.md).) |
|  | GetHashCode | Serves as a hash function for a particular type.  (Inherited from Object.) |
|  | GetType | Gets the Type of the current instance. (Inherited from Object.) |
|  | [IsValid](bcd3ba1e-de42-cca3-3815-4c8f41c690a4.md) | Checks whether this HermiteSurface object is valid. |
|  | [Project](802cc09b-d0a4-dfc5-8ca1-e8c5e8cd4ced.md) | Project a 3D point orthogonally onto a surface (to find the nearest point). Throws InvalidOperationException if the projection fails.  (Inherited from [Surface](bb391358-5ca0-578d-e8e2-6d1b30c472d8.md).) |
|  | [ProjectWithGuessPoint](db8cc42a-9f34-611a-d9c5-852f3935887f.md) | Project a 3D point orthogonally onto a surface (to find the nearest point). This method is meant to be used when a good approximate solution for the projection is available. Throws InvalidOperationException if the projection fails.  (Inherited from [Surface](bb391358-5ca0-578d-e8e2-6d1b30c472d8.md).) |
|  | ToString | Returns a string that represents the current object. (Inherited from Object.) |
  
# Properties

|  | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | [IsValidObject](6429595a-a6e1-2501-1e60-9c53814a9108.md) | Specifies whether the .NET object represents a valid Revit entity.  (Inherited from [Surface](bb391358-5ca0-578d-e8e2-6d1b30c472d8.md).) |
|  | [OrientationMatchesParametricOrientation](451b549f-2bc4-4f37-9f32-981fe18868a8.md) | Indicates whether this Surface's orientation is the same as or opposite to its parametric orientation.  (Inherited from [Surface](bb391358-5ca0-578d-e8e2-6d1b30c472d8.md).) |
