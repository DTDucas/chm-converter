Checks if the bar at index barPositionIndex it's matched in reversed order with its shape. 

**Namespace:** [Autodesk.Revit.DB.Structure](d586b341-f687-9d90-e96d-255806b7d4fc.md)**Assembly:** RevitAPI (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 24.0.0.0 (24.0.0.0)**Since:** 2019 

# Syntax

    public bool IsBarMatchedWithShapeInReverseOrder(
    	int barPositionIndex
    )

    Public Function IsBarMatchedWithShapeInReverseOrder ( _
    	barPositionIndex As Integer _
    ) As Boolean

    public:
    bool IsBarMatchedWithShapeInReverseOrder(
    	int barPositionIndex
    )  
  
#### Parameters

barPositionIndex
    Type: System..::..Int32 An index between 0 and (NumberOfBarPositions-1). 

#### Return Value

Returns true if the bar is matched in reversed order with its shape, false otherwise. 

# Remarks

If this Rebar has Workshop Instructions set to Straight will return false for all barPositionIndex between 0 and (NumberOfBarPositions-1).

If this Rebar has Workshop Instructions set to Bent there are different cases: 

  * All bars are matched exactly with a shape. In this case will return false for all barPositionIndex between 0 and (NumberOfBarPositions-1).
  * All bars are matched in reversed order with a shape. In this case the Rebar will be reversed and will return false for all barPositionIndex between 0 and (NumberOfBarPositions-1).
  * Some bars are matched in reversed order and the others are matched exactly with a shape. For the bars matched in reversed order will return true and for the others will return false
