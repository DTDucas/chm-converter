| [Dispose](4128714b-ffca-6468-d0f3-bc69d713c37b.md "Dispose Method") | (Inherited from [FieldDomainPoints](5b145517-1904-4b5f-2f66-0d84b259335b.md "FieldDomainPoints Class").) |
| Equals | Determines whether the specified Object is equal to the current Object. (Inherited from Object.) |
| GetHashCode | Serves as a hash function for a particular type.  (Inherited from Object.) |
| GetType | Gets the Type of the current instance. (Inherited from Object.) |
| [SetGridCoordinates](09df1ba9-a23c-4564-884b-d93eac3fd8d2.md "SetGridCoordinates Method") | Set u and v coordinates that specify a grid on the surface. The display of the grid is controlled by AnalysisDisplayColoredSurfaceSettings::getShowGridLines(). If AnalysisDisplayColoredSurfaceSettings::getShowGridLines() returns true and both sets are empty then a grid will be displayed using a default spacing; if only one of the sets is non-empty, then only the corresponding set of grid lines will be displayed, i.e. the grid will consist solely of parallel lines at the specified coordinates. |
| ToString | Returns a string that represents the current object. (Inherited from Object.) |
