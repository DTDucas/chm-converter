#### Return Value

The ids of the stairs elements that govern groups of stairs, and the stairs elements that represent individual stairs.

Stairs elements returned by this method will either be members of groups of identical stairs instances which share the same level height, or individual Stairs instances which are not connected to a group with the same level height. Use [IsPinned(Stairs)](c9dea1f0-00e3-e5ab-d66d-84e6250accab.md) to identify if a Stairs is a member of a group or not.
