| [FabricationNetworkChangeService](bfcb69c6-abb2-8224-bee1-21db51c852ce.md "FabricationNetworkChangeService Constructor") | Creates a new instance of the FabricationNetworkChangeService class. |

# Methods
| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [ApplyChange](f9b261dc-80f8-00c9-425c-973d325a4379.md "ApplyChange Method") | Applies the previously set changes to the selection of fabrication parts to change the size, change the service, or both. |
| [ChangeService(ISet<(Of <<'(ElementId>)>>), Int32, Int32)](17ab8b80-947b-8205-a8d9-11e033a06b08.md "ChangeService Method \(ISet\(ElementId\), Int32, Int32\)") | Changes the service of the selection of fabrication parts. |
| [ChangeService(ISet<(Of <<'(ElementId>)>>), Int32, Int32, Boolean)](a5b4b046-ce67-bbaa-5107-cb72bae4595f.md "ChangeService Method \(ISet\(ElementId\), Int32, Int32, Boolean\)") | Changes the service of the selection of fabrication parts. |
| [ChangeSize](0b1e1aab-20f8-9de3-bbe7-9f5b5ab9c1ed.md "ChangeSize Method") | Changes the size of the selection of fabrication parts. |
| [Dispose](737c2175-ad3e-ca2b-e410-3ec745b55c7f.md "Dispose Method") | Releases all resources used by the [FabricationNetworkChangeService](ddd58cb0-54bc-a864-9688-b890a7140112.md "FabricationNetworkChangeService Class") |
| Equals | Determines whether the specified Object is equal to the current Object. (Inherited from Object.) |
| [GetElementsThatFailed](7bc30db4-1cae-1acb-c346-d164d5b90822.md "GetElementsThatFailed Method") | Gets the set of fabrication parts that had failures due to either there was no corresponding part in the service, the size was out of range, or a connection could not be made. |
| GetHashCode | Serves as a hash function for a particular type.  (Inherited from Object.) |
| [GetInLinePartTypes](c7ae31f2-0158-7673-64a8-2b983f8b37bf.md "GetInLinePartTypes Method") | Get a set of element identifiers of fabrication part types for in-line parts. |
| [GetMapOfAllSizesForStraights](34ceb348-135f-4349-b04d-814763d3bff7.md "GetMapOfAllSizesForStraights Method") | Get a set of FabricationPartSizeMapSet of all straight sizes for all services. |
| [GetStraightsThatWereNotChanged](644c47d9-806b-cd68-bf3e-0f8997c89f50.md "GetStraightsThatWereNotChanged Method") | Gets the set of fabrication part straights that were not changed due to either there was no corresponding part in the service or the size was out of range. |
| GetType | Gets the Type of the current instance. (Inherited from Object.) |
| [SetMapOfInLinePartTypes](433425ef-b5ae-6049-e67c-8149736c51ef.md "SetMapOfInLinePartTypes Method") | Set the mapping of fabrication part types for in-line parts for the service and palette to change to. |
| [SetMapOfSizesForStraights](3bf6d1da-663c-96e7-ec90-0b82f90efebb.md "SetMapOfSizesForStraights Method") | Set the mapping for sizes of fabrication part straights to change the sizes to. |
| [SetPaletteId](cb8405ce-67de-cea2-abda-a83b2053e0fc.md "SetPaletteId Method") | Set the fabrication palette identifier to change the elements to. |
| [SetRestrictPalette](0785a691-501f-5647-cbd3-95cd75c5e707.md "SetRestrictPalette Method") | Restrict the placement of parts to only use parts associated to the passed in fabrication palette identifier. |
| [SetSelection](f27088a0-3ee2-0a54-4051-e81b0e4a63f7.md "SetSelection Method") | Set the element selection to change the service or size for. |
| [SetServiceId](dc16382e-84f3-a3f0-c302-abc334133d2e.md "SetServiceId Method") | Set the fabrication service identifier to change the elements to. |
| ToString | Returns a string that represents the current object. (Inherited from Object.) |
