# Remarks
This property supersedes the older [!:LineWidth] property which has been deprecated.
The value is in sheet units, meaning it is as when measured on a printed sheet. The measurement is of the text content only; the border around it (if specified) is excluded.
For a text element which does is set not to use text wrapping the width is calculated to fit the longest line (a single line, typically) of the text. A setting the width explicitly by assigning value to this property will automatically activate text-wrapping for the element.
