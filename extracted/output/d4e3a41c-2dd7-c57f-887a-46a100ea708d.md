The [CurveByPointsUtils](20dd9f72-4653-4ea8-6397-af04e5093fbe.md) type exposes the following members.

# Methods

|  | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | [AddCurvesToFaceRegion](d63740d4-6052-12cd-a9f5-5915103562a6.md) | Adds The CurveElements to one or more FaceRegions. |
|  | [CreateArcThroughPoints](04482533-93ab-d3e2-db15-5f700919ab81.md) | Creates an arc through the given reference points. |
|  | [CreateRectangle](8d86256e-611d-0f81-e984-df9e0c6a6227.md) | Creates rectangle on face or sketchplane for two given diagonal points. |
|  | [Dispose](2548a0d5-4011-f2ad-cb16-a37a01385570.md) | Releases all resources used by the [CurveByPointsUtils](20dd9f72-4653-4ea8-6397-af04e5093fbe.md) |
|  | Equals | Determines whether the specified Object is equal to the current Object. (Inherited from Object.) |
|  | [GetFaceRegions](4dd110d1-ee73-928b-2b97-3ddd51d0591c.md) | Gets the FaceRegions in the existing face. |
|  | GetHashCode | Serves as a hash function for a particular type.  (Inherited from Object.) |
|  | [GetHostFace](19436661-0781-47be-8880-43f0eb451baf.md) | Gets the host face to which the CurveElement is added. |
|  | [GetProjectionType](deae9675-cffb-a240-27b5-f21e2fb7384d.md) | Gets the projection type of the CurveElement. |
|  | [GetSketchOnSurface](fe242e1f-cd4b-bcbb-c8b9-024006e0a84d.md) | Gets the relationship between the CurveElement and face. |
|  | GetType | Gets the Type of the current instance. (Inherited from Object.) |
|  | [SetProjectionType](4ca5d8c8-bb4a-71b2-57e7-4cda32c043b9.md) | Sets the projection type of the CurveElement. |
|  | [SetSketchOnSurface](acb48584-79f4-d323-8ed2-901e4d105752.md) | Sets the relationship between the CurveElement and face. |
|  | ToString | Returns a string that represents the current object. (Inherited from Object.) |
|  | [ValidateCurveElementIdArrayForFaceRegions](32b7739d-f1cf-2c6c-402b-6bd9c6751e47.md) | Validates that the input CurveElements can define FaceRegions. The CurveElements must be CurveByPoints. Each curve must be entirely hosted by a single Face or hosts related to a common Face (for example, Edges of a common Face, other CurveElements hosted by a common Face). To be added to the FaceRegion definition, a CurveElement must have the SketchOnSurface attribute set. |
  
# Properties

|  | Name | Description |
