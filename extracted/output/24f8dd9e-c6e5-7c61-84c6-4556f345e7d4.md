# Remarks

The state of the PreviewFamilyVisibility mode can be set only if the mode is currently available and enabled in the view. Even in such a condition, however, not all states are valid in all views. To ensure that the state to be applied is valid in the view, call the [IsValidState(PreviewFamilyVisibilityMode)](58a050cd-be15-c5f6-fb03-8bd16462faee.md) method first.

Even views which generally support temporary modes will have this particular mode available only when the document of the view is in the environment of the family editor.

This property affect only the view associated with this instance of TemporaryViewModes. When a view is opened for the first time, its state of the PreviewFamilyVisibility mode is determined based on the default settings which is controlled through the properties [PreviewFamilyVisibilityDefaultOnState](295a6ae9-e3c0-795c-d025-fa52b47eea63.md) and [PreviewFamilyVisibilityDefaultUncutState](1787a21c-c908-637b-46e9-841ac843d840.md).
