# Syntax

C#  
---  
      
    
    public bool Move(
    	[XYZ](c2fd995c-95c0-58fb-f5de-f3246cbc5600.md) translation
    )  
  
Visual Basic  
---  
      
    
    Public Function Move ( _
    	translation As [XYZ](c2fd995c-95c0-58fb-f5de-f3246cbc5600.md) _
    ) As Boolean  
  
Visual C++

    public:
    bool Move(
    	[XYZ](c2fd995c-95c0-58fb-f5de-f3246cbc5600.md)^ translation
    )  
  
#### Parameters

translation
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..XYZ](c2fd995c-95c0-58fb-f5de-f3246cbc5600.md)The vector by which the element is to be moved.

#### Return Value

If the element is moved successfully then the method return True, otherwise False.

# Remarks

The move method is used to move an element within the project. Other elements may also be moved when this element is moved, for example: if the element is wall and it contains windows, the windows will also be moved.

# Examples

CopyC#
    
    
    bool MoveUsingLocationCurve(Autodesk.Revit.ApplicationServices.Application application, Wall wall)
    {
        LocationCurve wallLine = wall.Location as LocationCurve;
        XYZ translationVec = new XYZ(10, 20, 0);
        return (wallLine.Move(translationVec));
    }

CopyVB.NET
    
    
    Private Function MoveUsingLocationCurve(application As Autodesk.Revit.ApplicationServices.Application, wall As Wall) As Boolean
        Dim wallLine As LocationCurve = TryCast(wall.Location, LocationCurve)
        Dim translationVec As New XYZ(10, 20, 0)
        Return (wallLine.Move(translationVec))
    End Function
