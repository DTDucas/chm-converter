# Properties
| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [BuildingPadNotConnected](3e290a46-d42a-be59-f645-9dcc499fecc3.md "BuildingPadNotConnected Property") | Can't create a single Pad with several connected regions. |
| [BuildingPadOverlap](aae9c5dd-448c-33b1-6109-3ffc289b5ac2.md "BuildingPadOverlap Property") | Pads can't overlap (but can share edges). |
| [CannotComputeProperArea](fa1bcbff-4c9d-50f5-08bc-e00b6a0ddbed.md "CannotComputeProperArea Property") | Property Lines must close. Area will not be computed. |
| [CannotIntersectSiteRegions](686f10cc-c058-8ca0-ed8f-7ed3fb76bff5.md "CannotIntersectSiteRegions Property") | Subregions cannot intersect. |
| [CannotMakeSurface](a9936d4c-fba4-1704-de45-09c9d6901f61.md "CannotMakeSurface Property") | Can't construct surface. |
| [ContourLabelEmpty](715cc841-0d3d-408d-c00c-25d51a46f312.md "ContourLabelEmpty Property") | Contour Label doesn't intersect any contours. |
| [EnterValueOrFormula](28c77b4b-4eff-8002-c17e-36e6612af330.md "EnterValueOrFormula Property") | Enter a value or a formula starting with '='. |
| [GradingInSamePhase](876f8db3-782b-9b06-cfd0-df07e3894179.md "GradingInSamePhase Property") | The Surface being Graded was created in the current Phase. Grading it will result in it being created and destroyed in the same Phase. |
| [NoHostForSubregion](6ac26086-fe9c-8f4d-6bde-e7b8e2f4b567.md "NoHostForSubregion Property") | This Subregion now does not appear to overlap any Toposurface with an appropriate Phase and Design Option. |
| [NoHostForSubregionWarn](83588d15-303f-997d-20ac-268d60fdfdb0.md "NoHostForSubregionWarn Property") | This Subregion now does not appear to overlap any Toposurface with an appropriate Phase and Design Option. |
| [NotEnoughPointsInSurface](5c1fd73a-5d75-e003-200a-5378e55512ca.md "NotEnoughPointsInSurface Property") | The surface must have at least three distinct Points. |
| [PointNotInSurface](4cd3afed-6d17-18bd-7a39-1f324002ccae.md "PointNotInSurface Property") | A Point is outside of the Surface boundary. Insert the Point on the boundary instead, and then drag it to the desired location. |
| [PointRelativeOutside](63d85894-0e5d-11b0-7cda-b570b7e447e6.md "PointRelativeOutside Property") | In order to place Points relative to the existing Surface, the Point must be placed within the area of the existing Surface. The height of the new Point will be relative to the current Surface elevation at that Point. |
| [PropertyIntersect](5db506ae-4a4c-a4a6-02da-57b6704a7bca.md "PropertyIntersect Property") | Property lines intersect. Area calculations will not be precise. |
| [RegionPhaseMismatch](fed90ae9-3f3b-58fd-a956-fa2f0349be63.md "RegionPhaseMismatch Property") | Subregions must have the same Phase Created parameter and Phase Demolished parameter as the host Toposurface. Subregion phase will be set to match the Toposurface. |
| [ResetToposurfacePhaseCreated](3a6aa337-4f25-30d9-e35f-7ed6c96e17d0.md "ResetToposurfacePhaseCreated Property") | The parameter Phase Created of the Toposurface is not set to the first Phase. No pre-existing toposurface were detected. The parameter will be reset to the first Phase unless Keep Phase Created option is picked. |
| [SiteEditPointsClipped](33ad4b6d-3b3f-53dc-82ee-87491bc91d8e.md "SiteEditPointsClipped Property") | Portions of the topographic surface or points on the surface may not be visible in this view due to clipping by the view. |
| [SiteEditPointsInvisible](97888ae2-1bb3-0718-8e9d-2416f4daade8.md "SiteEditPointsInvisible Property") | Topographic elements are not visible in your current view. You can modify View Range settings in the view's Properties or Visibility settings in Visibility/Graphics. It is often easier to edit topography in a Site view or a 3D view. |
| [SiteMergeDisconnected](e3c2aff7-ff06-91fb-86fb-80a5b50c8442.md "SiteMergeDisconnected Property") | The two surfaces you are trying to merge are disconnected from one another. They should overlap, or at least share edges. |
| [SitePhasesDontOverlap](e6ae6920-d59d-cdce-a373-5cdbdcf8f99d.md "SitePhasesDontOverlap Property") | The phases of the two surfaces you are merging do not overlap. You can continue the operation, or cancel it and select a different pair of surfaces. |
| [SiteRegionOptionConflict](7d06684d-c3fe-5266-63b6-bd83da0c82ce.md "SiteRegionOptionConflict Property") | Subregions must be in the same Design Option as their Toposurface. |
| [SurfaceSelfIntersection](dd9d049f-8c2a-8f12-db05-ebec0a50a9fb.md "SurfaceSelfIntersection Property") | The splitting boundary drawn would result in a self-intersection of the surface boundary. Please edit your splitting lines to correct the problem. |
| [SurfaceSplit](04070324-7a37-2dde-0a6c-aded0ca79524.md "SurfaceSplit Property") | The splitting boundary must split the Surface into exactly two pieces. |
| [SurfaceSplitError](81981017-4676-9e99-dfde-7f8eee0c573a.md "SurfaceSplitError Property") | The splitting boundary must split the Surface into exactly two pieces. |
| [SurfaceSplitNoIntersection](6ec0630c-b023-82d0-69c7-0bf869911d04.md "SurfaceSplitNoIntersection Property") | The splitting boundary must divide the Surface into separate pieces. There may be a gap in the splitting Lines or the Sketch may be incomplete. |
| [SurfaceTriangulationFailed](5cd014e3-447e-c847-98f0-5b177e65efca.md "SurfaceTriangulationFailed Property") | The Site Surface failed to triangulate. |
| [ToposolidSlopeExceedsThreshold](0109bb6f-5cae-c271-989d-54be8b081669.md "ToposolidSlopeExceedsThreshold Property") | Thickness of this Toposolid may be slightly inaccurate due to extreme Shape Editing. Dimensions to this element in sections and details may not accurately indicate the Thickness shown in Type Properties. |
