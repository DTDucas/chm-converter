A filter used to match elements by their class.

# Remarks

This filter is a quick filter. Quick filters operate only on the ElementRecord, a low-memory class which has a limited interface to read element properties. Elements which are rejected by a quick filter will not be expanded in memory. 

This filter will match elements whose class is an exact match to the input class, or elements whose class is derived from the input class.

There is a small subset of Element subclasses in the API which are not supported by this filter. These types exist in the API, but not in Revit's native object model, which means that this filter doesn't support them. In order to use a class filter to find elements of these types, it is necessary to use a higher level class and then process the results further to find elements matching only the subtype. The following types are affected by this restriction: 

  * Subclasses of Autodesk.Revit.DB.Material
  * Subclasses of Autodesk.Revit.DB.CurveElement
  * Subclasses of Autodesk.Revit.DB.ConnectorElement
  * Subclasses of Autodesk.Revit.DB.HostedSweep
  * Autodesk.Revit.DB.Architecture.Room
  * Autodesk.Revit.DB.Mechanical.Space
  * Autodesk.Revit.DB.Area
  * Autodesk.Revit.DB.Architecture.RoomTag
  * Autodesk.Revit.DB.Mechanical.SpaceTag
  * Autodesk.Revit.DB.AreaTag
  * Autodesk.Revit.DB.CombinableElement
  * Autodesk.Revit.DB.Mullion
  * Autodesk.Revit.DB.Panel
  * Autodesk.Revit.DB.AnnotationSymbol
  * Autodesk.Revit.DB.Structure.AreaReinforcementType
  * Autodesk.Revit.DB.Structure.PathReinforcementType
  * Autodesk.Revit.DB.AnnotationSymbolType
  * Autodesk.Revit.DB.Architecture.RoomTagType
  * Autodesk.Revit.DB.Mechanical.SpaceTagType
  * Autodesk.Revit.DB.AreaTagType
  * Autodesk.Revit.DB.Structure.TrussType
