| DimensionLocked | Failed due to not being able to change a locked or product listed dimension. |
| BadDimensions | Failed due to the required dimension values not being valid to fabricate. |
| ShapeMismatch | Failed due to shape mismatch of fitting ends. |
| SizeMismatch | Failed due to size mismatch of fitting ends. |
| IncompatibleConnection | Failed due to connectors being incompatible and no couplings found to resolve it. |
