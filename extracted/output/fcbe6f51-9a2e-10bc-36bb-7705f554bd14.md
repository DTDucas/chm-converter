Derived classes override this method to implement the test that determines whether the two given string values satisfy the desired condition or not. 

**Namespace:** [Autodesk.Revit.DB](87546ba7-461b-c646-cbb1-2cb8f5bff8b2.md)**Assembly:** RevitAPI (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 24.0.0.0 (24.0.0.0)**Since:** 2011 

# Syntax

C#

    public bool Evaluate(
    	string lhs,
    	string rhs,
    	bool caseSensitive
    )  
  
Visual Basic  
---  
      
    
    Public Function Evaluate ( _
    	lhs As String, _
    	rhs As String, _
    	caseSensitive As Boolean _
    ) As Boolean  
  
Visual C++

    public:
    bool Evaluate(
    	String^ lhs, 
    	String^ rhs, 
    	bool caseSensitive
    )  
  
#### Parameters

lhs
    Type: System..::..String A value from an element in the document. 

rhs
    Type: System..::..String The user-supplied value against which values from the document are tested. 

caseSensitive
    Type: System..::..Boolean If true, string comparisons are done case-sensitively. 

#### Return Value

True if the given arguments satisfy the condition, otherwise false. 

# Remarks

The arguments may be thought of as the left and right operands of a binary expression; for example, "a < b", "x >= 100", etc. The left operand comes from an element in the Revit document (e.g., the value of a parameter.) The right operand is supplied by the user when creating the filter that contains the rule that uses this evaluator.
