# Remarks

When a FailureDefinition is created, it will be registered in this registry automatically. Registration is allowed only during Revit Application startup - after that FailureDefinitionRegistry is locked and creation of new FailureDefinitions is not allowed. There is only one instance of FailureDefinitionRegistry in session. [GetFailureDefinitionRegistry()()()()](bc9ff9b9-5d87-1632-4a59-c3b5fd9cda25.md)
