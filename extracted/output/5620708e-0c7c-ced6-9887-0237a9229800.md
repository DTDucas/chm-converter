A table supporting a mapping of line weights in Revit to line weight names that will be set in the target export format.

# Remarks

This table is structured as a mapping from [ExportLineweightKey](5b3250ab-f70b-6f87-afbf-dd049a64c29e.md) to [ExportLineweightInfo](730cd713-bb8b-8a69-739e-d9bae8eb6fa5.md) members. The [ExportLineweightKey](5b3250ab-f70b-6f87-afbf-dd049a64c29e.md) contains the identification information for the pattern table: the Revit line weight. The [ExportLineweightInfo](730cd713-bb8b-8a69-739e-d9bae8eb6fa5.md) contains the line weight to use in the export format.

The table can be accessed via direct iteration as a collection of KeyValuePairs, or by traversal of the stored keys obtained from GetKeys(), or via specific lookup of a key constructed externally. In all cases, the [ExportLineweightInfo](730cd713-bb8b-8a69-739e-d9bae8eb6fa5.md) returned will be a copy of the [ExportLineweightInfo](730cd713-bb8b-8a69-739e-d9bae8eb6fa5.md) from the table. In order to make changes to the [ExportLineweightInfo](730cd713-bb8b-8a69-739e-d9bae8eb6fa5.md) and use those settings during export, set the modified [ExportLineweightInfo](730cd713-bb8b-8a69-739e-d9bae8eb6fa5.md) back into the table using the same key.
