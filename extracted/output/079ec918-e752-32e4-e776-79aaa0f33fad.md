#### Parameters

resolutionType
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..FailureResolutionType](786e6422-f66d-5320-99f9-e530819e50a1.md) The type of failure resolution to be used to resolve the failure. 

# Remarks

When FailuresAccessor is used to resolve failures, it will execute resolutions based on current resolution type. If no current resolution type is set, the default resolution type will be used. Setting is performed on the FailureMessageAccessor object itself, so if there are several accessors issued for the same FailureMessage, setting of the resolution type performed on one of them does not impact the others.
