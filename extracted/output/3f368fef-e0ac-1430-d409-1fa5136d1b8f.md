    static bool IsValidPathForRailing(
    	[CurveLoop](84824924-cb89-9e20-de6e-3461f429dfd6.md)^ curveLoop
    )  
  
#### Parameters

curveLoop
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..CurveLoop](84824924-cb89-9e20-de6e-3461f429dfd6.md) The railing path along which the new railing will be created. 

#### Return Value

True if the new railing path can be used in a railing definition, False otherwise. 

# Remarks

The railing path should be located on the same horizontal plane and it should contain lines or arcs only. It also has to be continuous and its three or more curves cannot meet in one end point.
