The [Frame](d44b3fd1-34d0-bfd0-55f6-de24235edf2e.md) type exposes the following members.

# Methods

|  | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | [CanDefineRevitGeometry](49a621dd-b76c-d0b2-7850-a846a14edbfe.md) | Tests whether the supplied Frame object may be used to define a Revit curve or surface. In order to satisfy the requirements the Frame must be orthonormal and its origin is expected to lie within the Revit design limits [IsWithinLengthLimits(XYZ)](ac2171af-4250-8a30-faa7-4d7030d29a03.md). |
|  | [Dispose](01664e31-f00c-d00b-4b5a-ae563a69e73b.md) |  |
|  | Equals | Determines whether the specified Object is equal to the current Object. (Inherited from Object.) |
|  | GetHashCode | Serves as a hash function for a particular type.  (Inherited from Object.) |
|  | GetType | Gets the Type of the current instance. (Inherited from Object.) |
|  | [IsOrthogonal](50351f59-56cc-0e6a-9db6-02b6b5cb0f21.md) | Determines if this frame's basis vectors are orthogonal. |
|  | [IsOrthonormal](8ef3b2a0-119d-12c1-9e13-a3a878e76580.md) | Determines if this frame's basis vectors are orthonormal. |
|  | [IsRightHanded](9a9727f4-270c-f6b0-60ce-482889e15213.md) | Determine if this frame's basis is right-handed. |
|  | ToString | Returns a string that represents the current object. (Inherited from Object.) |
|  | [Transform](50ef89f7-1c5b-46ad-a33d-911b6834f8e6.md) | Applies the input transform to this frame. |
