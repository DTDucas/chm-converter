#### Parameters

sketchId
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..ElementId](44f3f7b1-3229-3404-93c9-dc5e70337dd6.md) The Sketch element to be edited. 

# Remarks

The application will need to start a transaction to actually make changes to the Sketch element. SketchEditScope can only be started when there is no transaction active, thus it does not work for commands running in automatic transaction mode.
