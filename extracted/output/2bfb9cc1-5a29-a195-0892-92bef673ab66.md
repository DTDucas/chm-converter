    public:
    bool SavePositions(

#### Parameters

callback
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..ISaveSharedCoordinatesCallback](ed4eac2a-d482-7760-2ae7-855611d09c46.md) A callback object to resolve situations when Revit encounters modified links. 

#### Return Value

True if we saved the link or if there were no changes to save. False if the operation failed. 

# Remarks

While this operation does not clear the document's undo history, you will not be able to undo this specific action, since it saves the link's shared coordinates changes to disk. 

# Exceptions

| Exception | Condition |

| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions..::..InvalidOperationException](9e715f03-3884-e539-4dd6-8d7545733adc.md) | Revit could not save shared coordinates changes to the link or one of its nested links. |
