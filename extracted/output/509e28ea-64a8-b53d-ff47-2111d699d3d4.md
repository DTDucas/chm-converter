The [ViewShapeBuilder](f99edd24-4519-56d5-a5d6-aa1565a893af.md) type exposes the following members.

# Methods

|  | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | [AddCurve](f58d323e-97a7-6bae-5bbe-ef3af1213dcd.md) | Add a curve to the GRep associated to this ViewShapeBuilder. |
|  | [Dispose](efbfadf8-519d-7f66-8553-e887ed3058f1.md) | (Inherited from [ShapeBuilder](66c1678c-2e01-e0de-1386-5a0e1eb3ccff.md).) |
|  | Equals | Determines whether the specified Object is equal to the current Object. (Inherited from Object.) |
|  | GetHashCode | Serves as a hash function for a particular type.  (Inherited from Object.) |
|  | GetType | Gets the Type of the current instance. (Inherited from Object.) |
|  | [Reset](5b1b694c-0977-23cb-1799-1264ffa4a3dd.md) | Clears the accumulated geometry and resets other ViewShapeBuilder parameters to invalid values. |
|  | ToString | Returns a string that represents the current object. (Inherited from Object.) |
|  | [ValidateCurve(Curve)](c8ebf475-8f7c-100f-bd1f-351dba4a1149.md) | Validates curve to be added to the view-specific shape being constructed. Called by AddCurve() to validate input. Expects a valid view normal to be set prior to the call. |
|  | [ValidateCurve(Curve, DirectShapeTargetViewType)](3d36d4c2-f736-db7b-ae6a-945f89dce0b9.md) | Validates curve to be added to the view-specific shape being constructed. Called by AddCurve() to validate input. This function may be used to pre-validate the geometry being added to avoid AddCurve() throwing an InvalidArgumentException |
|  | [ValidateShape](6d5a7e8f-b0eb-51bc-7963-fa034792fe66.md) | Validates a shape represented as a collection of geometry objects for use as a view-specific shape. The objects are expected to be either points, curves or polylines. Curves are expected to be flat and lie in a plane perpendicular to view normal as defined by view type. |
|  | [ValidateViewType](682c6dd1-ee09-db45-91cf-85fba6b9dff6.md) | Validates the incoming view type. As of today, the only allowed view type is Plan. |
