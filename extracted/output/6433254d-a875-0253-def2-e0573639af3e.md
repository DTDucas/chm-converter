#### Parameters

point
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..XYZ](c2fd995c-95c0-58fb-f5de-f3246cbc5600.md) The point to be modified. 

elevationValue
    Type: System..::..Double The new elevation value. 

# Remarks

If the point doesn't exist in the current TopographySurface, an exception will be thrown. This applies to a TopographySurface element (not a SiteSubRegion or a topography surface associated with a BuildingPad), which should be in an active TopographyEditScope. 

# Exceptions

| Exception | Condition |
| --- | --- |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions..::..ArgumentException](2e6e4206-97a8-dd4b-df5d-4269f4bb6088.md) | The input point does not exist in the current topography surface. |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions..::..ArgumentNullException](631e1424-60f4-929b-4e52-dda9dcd26316.md) | A non-optional argument was null |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions..::..ArgumentOutOfRangeException](60f148c9-ece0-a6bb-4e12-bb4a9c8c8a24.md) | The given value for elevationValue must be no more than 30000 feet in absolute value. |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions..::..InvalidOperationException](9e715f03-3884-e539-4dd6-8d7545733adc.md) | This element is not a TopographySurface. -or- The points of this topography surface are not editable. -or- The TopographySurface element is not in an active TopographyEditScope. Modification cannot be made on this TopographySurface. |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions..::..ModificationForbiddenException](53205486-5917-7c33-8e67-e362106ddc97.md) | The document containing this TopographySurface is in failure mode: an operation has failed, and Revit requires the user to either cancel the operation or fix the problem (usually by deleting certain elements). -or- The document containing this TopographySurface is being loaded, or is in the midst of another sensitive process. |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions..::..ModificationOutsideTransactionException](8f025460-c283-ea99-aa8a-5a36e11528f4.md) | The document containing this TopographySurface has no open transaction. |
