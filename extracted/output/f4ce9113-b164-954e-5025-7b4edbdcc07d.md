# Syntax

C#  
---  
      
    
    public ICollection<[ElementId](44f3f7b1-3229-3404-93c9-dc5e70337dd6.md)> Delete(
    	ICollection<[ElementId](44f3f7b1-3229-3404-93c9-dc5e70337dd6.md)> elementIds
    )

    Public Function Delete ( _
    	elementIds As ICollection(Of [ElementId](44f3f7b1-3229-3404-93c9-dc5e70337dd6.md)) _
    ) As ICollection(Of [ElementId](44f3f7b1-3229-3404-93c9-dc5e70337dd6.md))

    public:
    ICollection<[ElementId](44f3f7b1-3229-3404-93c9-dc5e70337dd6.md)^>^ Delete(
    	ICollection<[ElementId](44f3f7b1-3229-3404-93c9-dc5e70337dd6.md)^>^ elementIds
    )  
  
#### Parameters

elementIds
    Type: System.Collections.Generic..::..ICollection<(Of <(<'[ElementId](44f3f7b1-3229-3404-93c9-dc5e70337dd6.md)>)>)> The ids of the elements to delete. 

#### Return Value

The deleted element id set. 

# Remarks

This method will delete the elements and any elements that are totally dependent upon that element. Any references to the deleted elements will become invalid and hence cause an exception to be thrown if they are accessed. The elements will be deleted with no prompts for user confirmation. Pinned elements will be deleted with no warnings. 

Note: in a family document, the predefined elements (those elements inherited from its family template file) can't be deleted by this method.

# Examples

CopyC#
    
    
    // Delete all the selected elements via the set of element ids.
    ICollection<Autodesk.Revit.DB.ElementId> idSelection = null ;

     ICollection<ElementId> selectedIds = uidoc.Selection.GetElementIds();
     foreach (ElementId id in selectedIds)
     {
         idSelection.Add(id);
     }
     ICollection<Autodesk.Revit.DB.ElementId> deletedIdSet = document.Delete(idSelection);
    
     if (0 == deletedIdSet.Count)
     {
         throw new Exception("Deleting the selected elements in Revit failed.");
     }
    
     TaskDialog.Show("Revit","The selected element has been removed.");

        Throw New Exception("Deleting the selected elements in Revit failed.")
    End If
    
    TaskDialog.Show("Revit", "The selected element has been removed.")
