Replaces Revit's default user interface (if present) with alternative handling for all warnings and errors (including those not generated by your application) for the rest of the Revit session; if your application is not prepared to respond to all warnings and errors, consider use of IFailuresPreprocessor (in your opened Transaction) or the FailuresProcessing event instead of this interface. 

**Namespace:** [Autodesk.Revit.ApplicationServices](91957e18-2935-006c-83ab-3b5b9dbb5928.md)**Assembly:** RevitAPI (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 24.0.0.0 (24.0.0.0)

    public:
    static void RegisterFailuresProcessor(

#### Parameters

processor
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..IFailuresProcessor](34a78265-3a7d-ba7f-5467-764fc9efe619.md) Instance of Failures Processor to be used by the Revit Application. 

# Remarks

If there is previously registered Failures Processor, it gets discarded. If you opt to register a FailuresProcessor for Revit, your processor will become the default error handler for all Revit errors for the session. The standard Revit error dialog will not appear.
