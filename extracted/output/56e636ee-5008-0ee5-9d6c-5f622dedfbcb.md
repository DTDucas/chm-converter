    )  
  
#### Parameters

loadedFamily
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..Family](f51d019d-6ff3-692b-d1d2-b497cab564de.md)The loaded family in current document.

#### Return Value

Reference of the document of the family.

# Remarks

This creates an independent copy of the family for editing. To apply the changes back to the family stored in the document, use the LoadFamily overload accepting [IFamilyLoadOptions](d447ed92-74e1-2125-dd0a-38a5ae85ce53.md). 

This method may not be called if the document is currently modifiable (has an open transaction) or is in a read-only state. The method may not be called during dynamic updates. To test the document's current status, check the values of IsModifiable and IsReadOnly properties.
