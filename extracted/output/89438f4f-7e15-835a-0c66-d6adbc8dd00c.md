    public:
    virtual property [Location](3dbe57e5-fdea-5bf9-c715-52653f56073f.md)^ Location {
    	[Location](3dbe57e5-fdea-5bf9-c715-52653f56073f.md)^ get ();
    }  
  
# Remarks

The Location property returns an object that can be used to find the location of an object within the project. An object may have a point location, such as a table or may have a line location. A wall is an example of an element that has a line location.
