#### Parameters

modelPath
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..ModelPath](40a84c72-e4b8-72ac-2f71-3216c66a11b3.md) The file to be opened. 

openOptions
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..OpenOptions](c0004971-3810-eeb8-72bd-e116886ec3c8.md) Options for opening the file. 

openFromCloudCallback
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..IOpenFromCloudCallback](266c8a04-c451-539d-8885-1626b131931d.md) The interface implementation to use when opening a cloud document. Only used for opening cloud model. 

#### Return Value

The opened document.

This method opens the document into memory but does not make it visible to the user in any way. If the user currently has ownership of elements in this model and there is no local model on this machine, Revit will post a warning.
