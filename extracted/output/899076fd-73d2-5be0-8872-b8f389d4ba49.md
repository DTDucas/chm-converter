#### Parameters

line
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..Line](e7329450-434a-918b-661c-65e15e0585a5.md)The line location of family instance. The line must in the plane of the view. 

symbol
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..FamilySymbol](a1acaed0-6a62-4c1d-94f5-4e27ce0923d3.md)A family symbol object that represents the type of the instance that is to be inserted.

specView
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..View](fb92a4e7-f3a7-ef14-e631-342179b18de9.md)A 2D view in which to display the family instance.

# Remarks

This overload applies only to 2D family line based detail symbols. The type/symbol that is used must be loaded into the document before this method is called. Families and their symbols can be loaded using the Document.LoadFamily or Document.LoadFamilySymbol methods.
