On a curved surface, BeltMeasurement specifies where the grid's distances are measured.

# Syntax

    public double BeltMeasurement { get; set; }  
  
Visual Basic

    Public Property BeltMeasurement As Double
    	Get
    	Set  
  
Visual C++

    public:
    property double BeltMeasurement {
    	double get ();
    	void set (double value);
    }  
  
# Remarks

On a conical surface, the distance between the radial gridlines is not constant. To interpret the Distance property, a circumferential gridline is taken as the "belt." Distance is then measured along the belt. The BeltMeasurement property gives the location of the belt relative to the extremes of the surface. The belt is used whenever gridlines are not parallel. It defaults to 0.5.
