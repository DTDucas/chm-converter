Rotate the element within the project by a specified angle around a given axis.

**Namespace:** [Autodesk.Revit.DB](87546ba7-461b-c646-cbb1-2cb8f5bff8b2.md)**Assembly:** RevitAPI (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 24.0.0.0 (24.0.0.0)

# Syntax

    public bool Rotate(
    	[Line](e7329450-434a-918b-661c-65e15e0585a5.md) axis,
    	double angle

    Public Function Rotate ( _
    	axis As [Line](e7329450-434a-918b-661c-65e15e0585a5.md), _
    	angle As Double _
    ) As Boolean  
  
Visual C++

    public:
    bool Rotate(
    	[Line](e7329450-434a-918b-661c-65e15e0585a5.md)^ axis, 
    	double angle
    )  
  
#### Parameters

axis
    Type: [Autodesk.Revit.DB..::..Line](e7329450-434a-918b-661c-65e15e0585a5.md)An unbounded line that represents the axis of rotation.

angle
    Type: System..::..DoubleThe angle, in radians, by which the element is to be rotated around the specified axis.

#### Return Value

If the element is rotate successfully then the method returns True, otherwise False.

# Remarks

The rotate method is used to rotate an element within the project. Other elements may also be rotated when this element is rotated because they are dependent upon the element being rotated. An unbounded line for the axis can be created by using the Application.Create object and its methods.

# Examples

CopyC#
    
    
    bool LocationRotate(Autodesk.Revit.ApplicationServices.Application application, Autodesk.Revit.DB.Element element)
    {
        bool rotated = false;
        // Rotate the element via its location curve.
        LocationCurve curve = element.Location as LocationCurve;
        if (null != curve)
        {
            Curve line = curve.Curve;
            XYZ aa = line.GetEndPoint(0);
            XYZ cc = new XYZ(aa.X, aa.Y, aa.Z + 10);
            Line axis = Line.CreateBound(aa, cc);
            rotated = curve.Rotate(axis, Math.PI / 2.0);
        }
    
        return rotated;
    }

CopyVB.NET
    
    
    Private Function LocationRotate(application As Autodesk.Revit.ApplicationServices.Application, element As Autodesk.Revit.DB.Element) As Boolean
        Dim rotated As Boolean = False
        ' Rotate the element via its location curve.
        Dim curve As LocationCurve = TryCast(element.Location, LocationCurve)
        If curve IsNot Nothing Then
            Dim line__1 As Curve = curve.Curve
            Dim aa As XYZ = line__1.GetEndPoint(0)
            Dim cc As New XYZ(aa.X, aa.Y, aa.Z + 10)
            Dim axis As Line = Line.CreateBound(aa, cc)
            rotated = curve.Rotate(axis, Math.PI / 2.0)
        End If
    
        Return rotated
    End Function
