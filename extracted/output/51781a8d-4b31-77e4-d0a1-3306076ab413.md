# Methods

|  | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | [AddCurve](79bc72c0-378a-d4a5-bcad-56dd30e4dd73.md) | Add a curve to the shape representation stored in this WireframeBuilder. |
|  | [AddPoint](5334339f-09ee-5ea2-6f11-29276c6e5cf6.md) | Add a point to the shape representation stored in this WireframeBuilder. |
|  | [Dispose](efbfadf8-519d-7f66-8553-e887ed3058f1.md) | (Inherited from [ShapeBuilder](66c1678c-2e01-e0de-1386-5a0e1eb3ccff.md).) |
|  | Equals | Determines whether the specified Object is equal to the current Object. (Inherited from Object.) |
|  | GetHashCode | Serves as a hash function for a particular type.  (Inherited from Object.) |
|  | GetType | Gets the Type of the current instance. (Inherited from Object.) |
|  | [Reset](283c0e09-d090-d0e3-0b67-5b0b76dc7f2d.md) | Clears the accumulated geometry. |
|  | ToString | Returns a string that represents the current object. (Inherited from Object.) |
|  | [ValidateCurve](a0cf31ee-9297-17ae-f947-dfdcb4c85ebc.md) | Validates curve to be added to the wireframe shape being constructed. Used by addCurve to validate input. This function may be used to pre-validate the geometry being added to avoid an exception from AddCurve(). |
|  | [ValidatePoint](f1c9fba9-45a1-4a31-468c-473ae5c3af24.md) | Validates the point object to be added to the wireframe shape being constructed. Used by AddPoint() to validate input. |
