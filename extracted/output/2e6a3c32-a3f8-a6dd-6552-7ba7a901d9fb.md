# Remarks

Notes:

  * Only numeric parameter values could be treated as by range.
  * There will exist at least two entries if the scheme is by range, and the first entry value should be always Int.MinValue or -Double.MaxValue.
  * The entries will always be sorted by ascending in the scheme if it is by range.
