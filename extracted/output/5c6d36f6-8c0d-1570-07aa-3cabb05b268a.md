# Remarks

The triangulation consists of a number of TriangulatedShellComponents. For a solid, there will be one TriangulatedShellComponent for each component of the solid's boundary. For example, a solid cube has just one boundary component (containing six faces), so there will be just one TriangulatedShellComponent. A solid consisting of two disjoint cubes has two boundary components (the boundaries of the two cubes), so there will be two TriangulatedShellComponents. A solid consisting of a sphere with a round void (or hole) inside it also has two boundary components (the outer sphere and the inner sphere), so there will be two TriangulatedShellComponents. 

For a shell, there will be one TriangulatedShellComponent for each component of the shell. 

Note that this class does not contain information on the containment structure of the boundary components of a solid. 

Be careful not to confuse the components of a solid with the solid's boundary components. This class deals only with the boundary components.
